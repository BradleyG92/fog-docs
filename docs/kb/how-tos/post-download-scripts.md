# Post Download Scripts

Fog has the ability to run bash scripts to add various automations after an image finished downloading to a host. This page will eventually outline these in detail but it is a place holder for now.

There is lots of information on this topic in the forums that will be organized and moved into this page and maybe some sub-pages

See these posts for some more examples
