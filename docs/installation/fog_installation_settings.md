# Fog installation settings

All your choices during the installation are saved in the file
/opt/fog/.fogsettings.

Then next time you start the installer, it will skip all questions and
continue at the \'Recap\'.

In this way you can easily re-install or update a Fog server.

For an overview of all settings in the .fogsettings file, see
[[knowledge-base/reference/install_fogsettings]]
