# Welcome to the Fog Project documentation!

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is under construction
> We are slowly moving from wiki.fogproject.org to here
> Once all existing docs are moved over we'll start updating the docs 

> [!warning]
> While we are migrating content there will be occasional changes to links and paths
> You will find that all (or at least most) pages have a `permalink` link below their labels/tags at the top of the page. This link is based on the markdown file name that creates the page and the last part of its full link. It is a shorter and permanent link to that given page, even if it moves to a new home. 
> For example, This page https://docs.fogproject.org/en/latest/management/web/dashboard/
> has a permalink of https://docs.fogproject.org/en/latest/dashboard 
> So even if the web management section moved elsewhere in the site, that permalink will get you to where ever that page is now.
