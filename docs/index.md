# Welcome to the Fog Project documentation!

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is under construction
> We are slowly moving from wiki.fogproject.org to here
> Once all existing docs are moved over we'll start updating the docs 

> [!warning]
> While we are migrating content there will be occasional changes to links and paths
> However, this documentation is versioned, so while the 'latest' version will have changes for the next bit. You can use https://docs.fogproject.org/en/1.5.9/ for linking to things that won't change. 
> Once all documentation from the wiki has been migrated into a sensible folder structure, these paths will no longer change
