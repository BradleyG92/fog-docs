Plugins give FOG extra functionality wanted for some users but not all.

----------------
Enabling Plugins
----------------

Plugins are not enabled on the FOG server by default, so this is the first thing we will need to do.

1. Log in to the FOG web UI.
2. Go to **FOG Configuration**
3. Go to **FOG Settings**
4. Scroll down and locate the section **Plugin System**
5. Tick on **FOG_PLUGINSYS_ENABLED**
6. Click "Save Changes"

After reloading the FOG web UI you see a new icon (gear wheel) in the main menu:

|main_menu_plugin_icon|

Activate Plugins
================

Lists all the available plugins to install

Install Plugins
===============

Lists all your "downloaded" plugins that are not activated yet

Installed Plugins
