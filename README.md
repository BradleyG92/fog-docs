## Headings

Below are examples of how to define the titles and headings and where they should be separated into new pages
Anything defined as a heading or title can be linked to from anywhere else with the following syntax

- If there are no spaces

```
`HeadingName`_
```

- if there are spaces

```
"`Heading Name`_"
```

### Title/heading 1

```
==============
Title/Heading1
==============
```

Titles go with top level title pages that match the root folder structure.
i.e. we have a `Management` folder. The index.rst in that folder contains the title for that section of pages.
The index.rst file for each title should have the title and then `..include:: filename.rst` lines for each file included.

Each of these titles should also be referenced in the root index page.

### SubTitle/Heading 2

```
------------------
SubTitle/Heading 2

#### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

#### Heading 5

#### Heading 6

## Building locally

see also (https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html)

To test and build documemtation locally you need the following

- Python 3.7+ (can install from python.org, windows store, apt-get, yum, chocolatey, etc.)
- sphinx (`pip install sphinx`)
- sphinx_rtd_theme (`pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`)

Once you have those pre-reqs installed follow these steps

- Clone the repo
- Add additional .rst documentation following the existing structure
- run `make.ps1` from the root of the repo
  - This will create your `.\_build` directory and run `make html` with the project's settings
  - This is just a powershell version of the autogenerated make.bat file. It has some built-in error handling to help find the sphinx-build.exe if it isn't added to your path

You will now have the files for the html site in you `_build` directory (the `_build` directory is excluded via .gitignore)
You can then open the `index.html` file from `.\_build\html` to browse the site locally.
