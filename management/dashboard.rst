Overview
========

|dashboard|

- The FOG dashboard is the first page you are presented with after login.
- This page just gives you an overview of what is happening on your FOG server.

System overview
===============

- The system overview box is the the top left hand box on this page. 
- The information presented in this box is 
    
    - the current user
    - the server IP addresses or hostnames for your web server
    - the server IP addresses or hostnames for your tftp server
    - the server IP addresses or hostnames for your storage server
    - This section also gives you the system uptime or how long the system has been running without restart
    - The system load

System Activity
===============

- The system activity box is in the top row, the middle box.
- This section shows the unicast queue, or the number of unicast deploys that are currently in progress.
    - The queue size can change and is based on the the Storage Group(s). 
    - Each storage node has a setting ''Max Clients'' making this the maximum number of hosts that this node can image to. 
        - If there are 2 nodes with a max of 10 each then your maximum queue amount is 20. 
        - However, remember the more you increase the ''Max Clients'' the slower each particular host will be to deploy the image. 
- This means that after 20 hosts are receiving images (at once) the 21st will wait for one of the hosts in progress to complete before starting.
- The reason this was created was so that you could queue up 100 machines with different images (all unicast) and still keep the system functional.
- We have heard of this queue being used to re-image an entire building of computers ( ~ 1000+ ) overnight.
- This section updates in real time. 
- It will display all the queued, running, etc... tasks and updates at the same interval as the Bandwidth graph.
- Also, SVN installations (and later future releases) are able to edit which type of tasks get counted towards the "queue".
    - This edit can be performed by going to **FOGConfiguration** |configIcon| --> **FOG Settings**--> **General Settings** --> **FOG\_USED\_TASKS**. 
    - The text field is numeric values (so you'll need to know which task id's are which type. 
    - This text field is a CSV setup. If you type (1,2,3,4,5) it will display all tasks of Deploy, Capture, Debug, Memtest, and Testdisk as queued/active depending on their current state.
    - The exception to this rule, is Task Type ID 8 (multicast) in which case it takes the Jobs, not each individual host task, as a queued slot.

Disk Information
================

- The disk information box is the top, right hand section of the dashboard page.
- This is a semi-realtime display of the storage remaining on the storage server.
- There is also a drop-down box that can be changed to your storage nodes to monitor their Disk Information.
- If you get an error in this box, please see [[Dashboard Error: Permission denied...]] #page doesn't exist in rst yet
