Overview
===========

.. Image:: img/Dashboard.png


- The FOG dashboard is the first page you are presented with after
login. This page just gives you an overview of what is happening on your
FOG server.

System overview
===============

- The system overview box is the the top left hand box on this page. Thekv
information presented in this box is the current user, the server IP
addresse or hostnames for your web server, tftp server and storage
server (which can all be different). This section also gives you the
system uptime or how long the system has been running without restart,
the number of users logged into the Linux box, and lastly the system
load.

System Activity
===============

The system activity box is in the top row, the middle box.
This section shows the unicast queue, or the number of
unicast deploys that are currently in progress. The queue size can
change and is based on the the Storage Group(s). Each storage node has a
setting ''Max Clients'' making this the maximum number of hosts that
this node can image to. If there are 2 nodes with a max of 10 each then
your maximum queue amount is 20. However, remember the more you increase
the ''Max Clients'' the slower each particular host will be to deploy
the image. *\ This means that after 20 hosts are receiving images (at
once) the 21st will wait for one of the hosts in progress to complete
before starting. The reason this was created was so that you could queue
up 100 machines with different images (all unicast) and still keep the
system functional. We have heard of this queue being used to re-image an
entire building of computers ( ~ 1000+ ) overnight. This section updates
in real time. *It will display all the queued, running, etc... tasks and
updates at the same interval as the Bandwidth graph. Also, SVN
installations (and later future releases) are able to edit which type of
tasks get counted towards the "queue".
*\ This edit can be performed by going to '''FOG
Configuration'''.. Image:: img/Config.png
--> '''FOG Settings'''--> '''General
Settings''' --> '''FOG\_USED\_TASKS'''. \*The text field is numeric
values (so you'll need to know which task id's are which type. This text
field is a CSV setup. If you type (1,2,3,4,5) it will display all tasks
of Deploy, Capture, Debug, Memtest, and Testdisk as queued/active
depending on their current state. The exception to this rule, is Task
Type ID 8 (multicast) in which case it takes the Jobs, not each
individual host task, as a queued slot.

Disk Information
================

*The disk information box is the top, right hand section of the
dashboard page. This is a semi-realtime display of the storage remaining
on the storage server. *\ There is also a drop-down box that can be
changed to your storage nodes to monitor their Disk Information. \*If
you get an error in this box, please see [[Dashboard Error: Permission
denied...]]
