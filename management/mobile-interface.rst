.. === Mobile Management Interface ===

.. ==== Overview ====

.. The FOG Mobile web interface is a very basic, stripped down interface for FOG.  It is designed to be given to lower level technicians using low powered, mobile devices such as iPod touches, iPhone, PDAs, and internet tablets.  The idea behind this interface is to make it easy for techs to re-image a computer while making the rounds at a site.

.. ==== Using the mobile Interface ====

.. The mobile interface can be access via:

.. http://x.x.x.x/fog/mobile

.. The portal requires a valid user name in password, which can be created via the FOG portal.

.. Once logged into the portal, users can search for hosts and image them, and view/cancel active tasks.

.. They can not change image associations, nor modify any properties of a host.
