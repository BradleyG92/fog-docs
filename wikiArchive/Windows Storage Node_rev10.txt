= Windows Storage Node =
*This is for <span style="background-color:RED; color:Orange; boarder:solid thin black">STORAGE NODES '''ONLY'''</span> you will still need a Linux install running as the main server. However, this will be part of the building blocks for a windows server build that yet does not exist.
*This has been put together from the forum and should be useful to many. [http://fogproject.org/forum/threads/fatal-error-failed-to-mount-nfs-volume.10457/#post-26912 Windows Server NFS]

==Requirements==
#Windows Server 2008 (R2)/Windows Server 2012 (R2)
#NFS Role Installed (NFS)
#Filezilla Installed (FTP)

==Windows Step-by-Step==
=== Folder Creation & Setup ===
*'''Create folders'''
*#'''Create folder C:\images'''
*#'''Create folder C:\images\dev

*'''Set Sharing'''
[[File:NFS Sharing1.png|center|]]


*'''Set Permissions''': Set proper permissions for All Machines

*'''Set Security''': Make sure you do this for C:\, C:\images, and C:\images\dev

|}

===Filezilla Setup (FTP)===
*'''Setup Filezilla Account''': Create fog account and make sure this is the same password for your ''Management password''
[[File:Filezilla1.png|center|frame|Create fog account and make sure this is the same password for your ''Management password'']]


*'''Setup Filezilla Folders''': Make sure these files $ Directories all have Read, write, delete, append rights

===Windows Policies===
*'''Set Local Policies''': Set this policy to Enabled
[[File:Local policy settings.jpg|center|frame|Set this policy to enabled]]

===NFS===
*'''Configure NFS Server''': Stop NFS Server Service, Edit Transport Protocol to TCP+UDP, and Start NFS Server Service
{|style="margin: 0 auto;"

|[[File:Nfs tcp+udp.jpg]]
|}

==Fog Server==
*Here is the tricky part.....You need to copy the hidden files on your Linux server to your windows server. These files are located @:

*/images/.mntcheck --> c:\images\
*/images/dev/.mntcheck --> c:\images\dev\

*xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ==> ip address of the windows server

*I mounted the NFS drive and just did a cp command.

*'''Using terminal or ssh remote:'''
<pre>
cd /
sudo mkdir images2
sudo chmod 777 images2
sudo mount xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/images /images2
sudo cp /images/.mntcheck /images2
sudo cp /images/dev/.mntcheck /images2/dev/
sudo umount /images2
</pre>

==Fog Web GUI==
*Then continue by adding a storage node just as you would in the wiki.

*I Simply added a Storage Node Definition in its own Storage Group independent to the default storage Group, added it's IP 172.19.102.6 and the path /images/ because it's the path 172.19.102.6 exports also /images/dev/ like an original FOG node does.

==Glitches==
*At times NFS does not want to replicate (minimally after restarts) so need of restarting the NFS service is required.
