On School Guardian, you'd implement as follows: 

=== 0.32 and below ===
 
#in Services > DHCP > DHCP Server, select your subnet and click the advanced button 
#under "TFTP server" enter the IP of your FOG server ("TFTP Server" field = DHCP "nextserver" field) 
#under "Network boot filename" enter the filename on the TFTP server, which AFAICT is pxelinux.0 
#Click save at the bottom of the page. You'll need to restart the DHCP services via Services > DHCP > Global

=== 0.33 and up ===

#in Services > DHCP > DHCP Server, select your subnet and click the advanced button 
#under "TFTP server" enter the IP of your FOG server ("TFTP Server" field = DHCP "nextserver" field) 
#under "Network boot filename" enter the filename on the TFTP server, which AFAICT is undionly.kpxe 
#Click save at the bottom of the page. You'll need to restart the DHCP services via Services > DHCP > Global
