*This is an option that has been successfully done on a few occasions and <u>'''NOT ALL'''</u> NAS devices work as a Storage node.
**This is a generic setup for NAS devices

== Basic Idea ==

*Install FOG storage node script on NAS and use it as a Storage node for your FOG server.
*A few basic things will need to be installed by the install script ssh, ftp, nfs, and mysql. 

== Installation ==

'''NOTE:''' It is assumed that you already have a working FOG server at this point in time. If you do not please ask in the [fogproject.org/forum forum] to get the server working first.

*First you must obtain (enable) ssh on your NAS to be able to even work with it.
**On some devices such as a "My Booklive" you will need to login to the web portal and enable it from there. See your device user manual for this.

*Download FOG from our [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/files/latest/download download page] or use a [[Upgrade_to_trunk | trunk version]].

*Unpack the FOG tar and navigate to fog/bin.

*Run install script ./install.sh

*Select mode '''S'''

*Go to your webgui of your FOG server
