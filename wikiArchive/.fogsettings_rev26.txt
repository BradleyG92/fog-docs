In most versions of FOG (including 1.2.0 and 1.3.0), the low-level settings that are used during installation and some settings that simply cannot be stored in the database are contained in the /opt/fog/.fogsettings file.

This file contains the setup of variables used within the installer during upgrades/installs.

Only gives some simplistic information to help users.
Does no actions just gives some information.

Does no actions, just tells where FOG's default variables are setup
Any new items will go below this, and you can add your own variables.
You can add variables wherever you want.

## End of FOG Settings
</pre>
== IP Address ==
Defines the IP address of the node/server.
This is also used on servers to setup the default.ipxe file.
<pre>
ipaddress='192.168.1.5'
</pre>
== Interface ==
This just sets the storage nodes/server interface as it will be stored in the Database.  This used to be used for multicast setups and for the bandwidth graph.  This is now setup so it is only used on the bandwidth graph as we already know the ip address anyway.  Multicast tasks can get their own interface instead of relying on user entry.
<pre>
interface='eth0'
</pre>
== Subnet Mask ==
This defines the subnet mask to use if the system is to be used as a DHCP server.  It will assume the subnet mask of the interface being used, but can be changed later if you see fit.
<pre>
submask='255.255.255.0'
</pre>
== Router Address ==
This will setup the router address to use if the system is to be used as a DHCP server.  It currently only sets as an ip address, but in the past contained the whole dhcp configuration string.  The config string was removed as it would only work on isc-dhcp-server, when some might be using dnsmasq or another dhcp server.
<pre>
routeraddress='192.168.1.1'
</pre>
== Plain Router ==
Very similar to the Router Address elements above, but can be used to redirect to maybe another router/switch other than the main.
<pre>
plainrouter='192.168.1.1'
</pre>
== DNS Address ==
=== dnsaddress ===
Used, again, for DHCP setup.
<pre>
dnsaddress='192.168.1.5'
</pre>
=== dnsbootimage ===
No longer used.  It's purpose was originally because the FOS (Fog Operating System -- init.xz/init_32.xz/init.gz) did not dynamically get the dns address from DHCP as dhcp was not called.
<pre>
dnsbootimage='192.168.1.5'
</pre>
== Linux Login/FTP ==
=== Username ===
This variable is the user setup for the linux user on the server.  This allows a user to login to the server/node under this username through linux.  The purpose of this is more specifically setup for FTP usage.
