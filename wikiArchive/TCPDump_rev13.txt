'''Looking at the packets.'''


Using TCPDump to capture all traffic going into and out of an interface on Linux:
<pre>sudo tcpdump -w issue.pcap -i eth0</pre>


You might need to change the interface name in the above command if you're interface is named differently. This command will list all available interfaces; pick the right one (not the loop-back interface):
<pre>ip link show</pre>


Run the above tcpdump command on the FOG machine, then start the remote target host. Wait until the remote target host fails, then stop tcpdump using '''ctrl+c''', transfer the PCAP file to your PC and examine it using [https://www.wireshark.org/ Wireshark.] 


After the capture is completed and you've opened the PCAP file, please use the MAC address of the target host as the filter for sender & receiver. The below example filter basically does this:  ( Show packet if Sending MAC equals xxxxxxx OR Receiving MAC equals xxxxxx )

Example Filter (change the MAC addresses):
<pre>eth.dst == 00:0C:CC:76:4E:07 || eth.src==00:0C:CC:76:4E:07</pre>
