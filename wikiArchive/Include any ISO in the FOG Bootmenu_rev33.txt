= PartedMagic =

In this example I will use the PartedM agic ISO, but Clonezilla, Linux distributions, Hirens Boot CD, and other bootable ISO's can be used.

Create a folder in  /tftpboot/fog/  called partedmagic,  copy the partedmagic.iso file into this folder and also copy and paste the MemDisk file found in /tftpboot/fog/ 

Browse to /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/ and edit the 'default' file in there and add:



<pre>
LABEL PartedMagic
        kernel fog/partedmagic/memdisk 
        append iso initrd=fog/partedmagic/partedmagic.iso raw
        MENU PartedMagic
        TEXT HELP
        Gparted + Clonezilla + Firefox
        ENDTEXT
</pre>

Please remember that if you create a new folder in the /tftpboot directory you will also need to include MemDisk in the same folder!  The link above also includes a TFTP folder you can use to try on your own.  It includes DBAN and Dell diagnostics's .ISO's.

Note: In FOG 1.3.0+, the MemDisk kernel is included as a default unless specified otherwise.
