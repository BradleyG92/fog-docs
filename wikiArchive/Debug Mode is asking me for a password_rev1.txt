The FOG installer sets in invalid/unknown password for debug mode because the potential power it would give to the end user.  So if you would like to access debug mode, you must set a password by performing the following steps:

#Login to the Web UI
#Go to '''other information''' (the 'i' icon)
#Select '''PXE Boot Menu'''
#Enter at least a Master Password as well as a password for any other resource you would like to protect.
#Click '''Save PXE Menu'''
