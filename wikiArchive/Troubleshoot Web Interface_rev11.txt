= Fatal error: Allowed memory size of xxxxxxxx bytes exhausted =

Reference: [https://forums.fogproject.org/topic/6234/fog-version-5507-cannot-access-host-management Fog Version 5507 Cannot Access Host Management]

'''Solution:''' Raise the web interface's memory limit:
<font color="red">FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> General Settings -> FOG_MEMORY_LIMIT</font> 

It’s done in megs, so 128 = 128M, 256 = 256M etc…

= Manually test WOL =

This is the web address to manually test FOG's WOL functionality:

<pre>http://x.x.x.x/fog/management/index.php?sub=wakeEmUp&mac=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff</pre>

Where x.x.x.x is your FOG server's IP address, and aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff is the MAC address of the host you wish to wake up.

For instance, if my FOG server's IP is 10.0.0.7 and the target host's MAC is 14:fe:b5:df:fc:7e  I would then put the below web address into the address bar of a web browser and then press enter / click go. 

[http://10.0.0.7/fog/management/index.php?sub=wakeEmUp&mac=14:fe:b5:df:fc:7e http://10.0.0.7/fog/management/index.php?sub=wakeEmUp&mac=14:fe:b5:df:fc:7e]

After doing this, the target host will be sent a WOL packet from the FOG server.
