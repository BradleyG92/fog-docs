== Unable to connect to tftp server ==

=== For Versions Before 0.24 ===


This seems to be caused by a password issue,

 1. From the fog management interface, go to users.
 2. Reset the fog user password.
 3. Click the "I" icon - "Other Information"
 4. Click "Fog Settings" in the menu on the left
 5. Replace the FOG_TFTP_FTP_PASSWORD and the FOG_NFS_FTP_PASSWORD fields under FOG settings with 
    your Linux fog user password. (Seems like FOG_NFS_FTP_PASSWORD is gone for ver .24).

=== For Versions .24-.32 ===

*Reset the local password for user fog with:  [sudo] passwd fog
*In management front end, go to '''Storage Management''' -> '''All Storage Nodes'''
*Click on '''DefaultMember'''
*Change the '''Management Password''' to match the password you just changed.
*Then go to '''Other Information''' and change '''FOG_TFTP_FTP_PASSWORD''' also.


* Go to your fog web location, on Red Hat and CentOS is in:
 /var/www/html/fog/

Then open the file:
 /commons/config.php

and check the values of:
'''TFTP_FTP_PASSWORD''' and '''STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD'''

These '''MUST''' match the password you set above, if not write them properly in here

Finally reload of the service

 /etc/init.d/vsftpd reload

=== For Versions 0.33-1.x.x ===
*See '''[[tftp timeout....]]''' for help

=== Verify Server Settings ===

If you have modified your server setup since first install, then the new changes must be updated and verified in the '''Fog Settings''' menu. 
It might not be enough to just re-run the installer.
For instance, a new IP lease will cause the server to show the '''Unable to connect to tftp server''' error message.

* Go to the "I" icon, which is the '''About''' menu in 0.29
* Select '''Fog Settings''' and navigate down to '''TFTP Settings''' and verify that all options are correct for your setup.

=== Ensure nothing else on the network is conflicting with the DHCP server ===

I had this error the past two days and tried all of the standard suggestions. Finally Wireshark came to the rescue. I discovered a second, feral DHCP server on the network that wasn't issuing IP addresses but must have been running interference somehow. When I disconnected it from the network, PXE boot worked as expected.
