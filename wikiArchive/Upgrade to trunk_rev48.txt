=Methods=
*There are a few methods to update to the most resent revision. Each method has its pros so, you will need to figure out which you will use.
**'''SVN'''
**'''Git'''
**'''BTSync'''
**'''wget'''
*Remember these are mostly betas so there are bound to be bugs, but with bugs also comes fixes of the issues found in the "Stable Release"
*If you have nodes they will also need to be upgraded! (Excluding Beta [[Windows_Storage_Node | Windows Nodes]])


==SVN==
*Install as seen in '''[[SVN]]'''
<pre>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/freeghost/code/trunk /some/local/folder</pre>

*Then navigate to the folder you specified and run:

<pre>sudo /some/local/folder/bin/./installfog.sh</pre>

====Update from prior downloaded SVN====
<pre>cd  /some/local/folder/
svn up
cd bin
./installfog.sh</pre>

*''NOTE:'' You must run '''svn up''' in the "/some/local/folder/" and not in ".../fog/bin" nor in ".../fog"


----
==Git==

*Install Git

<pre>
sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

*Initial Setup
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject.git /some/local/folder
</pre>

*Update to latest
<pre>
cd /some/local/folder
git pull
cd bin
./installfog.sh
</pre>

*Check your git version
<pre>
cd /some/local/folder
git log -1
</pre>

----

==BTSync==
*If you want the latest, get on the BTsync :) You could have changes within 20-30 seconds of them being made.
**'''NOTE:''' as of 2901 the kernels are no longer synced using BTSync. They auto download when installing the fog script.
<pre>
Fog Read only Secret: BAU3NUY3XTKVMHHEZO6C7OH55AN2PCGJV
</pre>

*Create the location that you want to have synced.

<pre>
sudo mkdir /fog
sudo chrmod 777 /fog
</pre>

*Install BTsync:

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tuxpoldo/btsync
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install btsync
cd Downloads
tar xzpf btsync_i386.tar.gz (I have downloaded 32 bit. So check your version)
./btsync
</pre>

*Open a webpage: <IP Address>:8888

<pre>
Add Folder:
Secret: BAU3NUY3XTKVMHHEZO6C7OH55AN2PCGJV
Path: /fog
</pre>

*Then <u>'''Any time'''</u> you see an update. Open up your terminal:

<pre>
cd /fog/bin/
sudo ./installfog.sh
</pre>
And you are updated quite quickly!

==wget==
<pre>
wget --no-check-certificate http://mastacontrola.com/fog_trunk.tar.bz2
</pre>
*Once downloaded you'll need to unpack the bz2 file using the command:
<pre>
tar -xjf fog_trunk.tar.bz2
</pre>
*Then go into the unextracted file.  Follow these steps:
<pre>
  cd fog_trunk/bin
  ./installfog.sh
</pre>

= Congratulations =
* Congrats! You have now upgraded to the "bleeding edge" of FOG deployment. It is your responsibility to keep upgraded until the next "Stable Release". Until then you will see in the ''cloud'' of your ''Web Gui'' '''rXXXX'''. This indicates the revision you are now on.
*You can check for updates to the revisions under [[File:Config.png]] '''Fog Configuration'''. This will state the version you are on and what the lastest revision is.
