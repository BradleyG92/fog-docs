== * unable to move /images/dev/macaddress to /images/name-of-image ==

=== Problem ===
You receive the following error after an image has been created:

''* unable to move /images/dev/macaddress to /images/name-of-image''

The error will repeat indefinitely.

=== Cause ===

The FOG user does not have permission to write to the images directory on the FOG server (usually /images). This often occurs when the /images directory has been recreated or has had its permissions changed.

Another cause is the Image Type is not correct (i.e. You're trying to image multiple partitions as a single partition.)

There is a third cause, that involves your FTP passwords being incorrect making FOG unable to handle files via FTP

=== Resolution ===

==== Method 1 ====

# Turn off the computer being imaged.(you don't have to turn off the PC just run the command on your server)
# Ensure the FOG user has write permissions on the images directory.
# Run command as root ''chown -R fog:root /images''

Example: Use:

 chown -R fog.root /images  

Finally attempt to create the image again.

==== Method 2 ====

# Switch off the computer being imaged.
# On the FOG server go to your /images/dev directory and move the temporary image (macaddress.000) to /images
# Rename the temporary image (macaddress.000) to the name you have set up in the FOG WebUI
