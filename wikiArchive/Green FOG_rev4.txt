=== Green Fog ===
My green for was not working so I checked under ''Reports Management'' and then ''User Login Hist''.  The login times were all wrong.  I did the following:

 nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini

and modified this section:

 [Date]
 ; Defines the default timezone used by the date functions
 ; http://php.net/date.timezone
 ;date.timezone =
 ;fix dates in fog
 date.timezone = America/Toronto

Then reload apache:

 /etc/init.d/apache reload

Now the login times are correct so this will hopefully fix my problem with Green Fog. This is on Debian Wheezy and it may or may not apply to other systems and it may or may not be a factor. Making these changes may also blow up everything.
