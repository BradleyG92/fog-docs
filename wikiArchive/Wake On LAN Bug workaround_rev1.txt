== Wake On LAN does not work with etherwake ==
FOG-Version: 0.21

etherwake is located in: /usr/sbin/etherwake

The wol.php sourcecode reveals two things:

* FOG expects it here: /sbin
* it is expected to have a DIFERENT NAME(!) *argh* (ether-wake)

solution:
* become root
* ln -s /usr/sbin/etherwake /sbin/ether-wake  OR  cp /usr/sbin/etherwake /sbin/ether-wake
* visudo 
add this line:
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/ether-wake

WOL should work now. At least it does at my site.

Best Regards,
Roland
