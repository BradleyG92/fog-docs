= Stuck on /dev/sda =

Using Hard Disk: /dev/sda

After this, the capture will not continue to the next step until enter is pressed, then you receive the message:

"Saving Partition Table (GPT)…Invalid Partition DATA!"

Or your capture never progresses past this phase:

"Saving original partition table…"


Your particular capture issue means the disk has remnants of GPT partitions on them where they’re not expected to be.

You will need to put system you’re trying to capture from in an capture-debug state. Once at the prompt, run fixparts and accept the things it asks.

<pre>fixparts
/dev/sda
follow prompts to delete and then write changes with ‘w’
</pre>

From there, once fixed, you can type fog and it should begin the capture process without hanging.
