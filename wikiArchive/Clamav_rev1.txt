= New Instructions =
The following instructions are to build and use pre-built binaries for Clamav.  We've switched to this method over providing them for you as Clamav is constantly changing.  Building clamav into the inits didn't allow a simple method to upgrade Clamav so you're more in sync with the current information.  Building a static binary is slightly better, but still requires frequent updating to stay with their current code set.

Because of this, the FOG developers have decided to, still keep the tasking present, but not provide the Clamav files for you.  You will have to build your own clamav, or install them for your system.  As Clamav is now a mounted share of NFS, it's actually much simpler to maintain as all your clients will be on the same build of Clamav and you will not need to download the virus definitions on every client.

==Clamav on Debian Lenny==
The current version of clam with Debian stable aka Lenny does not seem to work with FOG.  I did the following to get clam working.

#First remove stable version of clam:  '''aptitude purge clamav-freshclam clamav clamav-daemon'''
#Now add the source for the newer version of clam:  '''nano /etc/apt/sources.list'''
#I added:  
<nowiki>#clam</nowiki>

<nowiki>deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile stable/volatile main contrib non-free</nowiki>
#'''aptitude update'''
#Now proceed with the fog installation script


'''Note:'''  The above must be done before you install fog.  For testing download the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file Eicar Test Virus] to a test workstation and run the clam task on that system.  Once the scan has finished the result can be found in the reports section of the FOG web interface.

==ClamAV on Ubuntu==
===Ubuntu 10.04 LTS===
<ol>
  <li>*Optional Steps*
    <ol>
      <li>Remove ClamAV installed with Fog because it's out of date and generates too many warnings when trying to update, if it updates at all</li>
      <li>Add the PPA to your sources list: ppa:ubuntu-clamav/ppa</li>
      <li>Get the newest clamav installed on your Fog Server</li>
      <li>Update your definitions by running freshclam</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
<li>Disable scripted updates and let ClamAV download definitions to the root of the web server. Add "ScriptedUpdates off" to the freshclam.conf file on the Fog Server.</li>
<li>Expand the Fog init file. (from [[Modifying_the_Init_Image]])
   <ul>
      <li>cd /tftpboot/fog/images</li>
      <li>gunzip init.gz</li>
      <li>mkdir initmountdir</li>
      <li>mount -o loop init initmountdir</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Modify the freshclam.conf file inside the init. Add "DatabaseMirror MyFogServerNameOrIP" and "ScriptedUpdates off" to this file.</li>
<li>Compress the init file.
   <ul>
      <li>cd /tftpboot/fog/images</li>
      <li>umount initmountdir/</li>
      <li>rmdir initmountdir</li>
      <li>gzip init</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Make symbolic links to the ClamAV files in the root of the web server
  <ul>
    <li>cd /var/www</li>
    <li>ln -s /var/lib/clamav/bytecode.cvd</li>
    <li>ln -s /var/lib/clamav/daily.cvd</li>
    <li>ln -s /var/lib/clamav/main.cvd</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Setup a virus scan task for a host and watch your client download the definitions from your Fog server and run the scan</li>
</ol>
