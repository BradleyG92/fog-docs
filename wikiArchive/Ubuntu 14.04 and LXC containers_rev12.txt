Ubuntu releases after 10.04 LTS do no longer provide unfs3 to workaround OpenVZ and LXC containers limitations

You have to download, compile and install unfs3 from sources.

* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/unfs3/files/ Download unfs3]
* decompress the archive : tar zxf unfs3-0.9.22.tar.gz
* apt-get install build-essential make flex bison
* cd unfs3-0.9.22
* ./configure
* make
* make install
* make install-init
* edit /etc/init.d/unfsd and replace the occurence of /usr/sbin/unfsd with /usr/local/sbin/unfsd
