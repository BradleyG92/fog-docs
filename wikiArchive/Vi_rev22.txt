Quick reference for basic editing in vi


i = go into insert mode, here you may use arrows to navigate text, and edit it with the keyboard as normal.
Esc (the escape key) = exit insert mode

WHEN NOT in insert mode you may use
:w (then enter) = write changes.
:q (then enter) = exit vi
:q! (then enter) = exit vi without saving changes.
