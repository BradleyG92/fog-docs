As a few people have had issues with iPXE booting correctly a, seemingly decent work around seems to work for most people.

= Configure system =
Obtain root access through terminal to your FOG Server.  There are multiple means to do so.

The most common methods are:
# Open a terminal or console window.
# Login as your self and sudo up to root, su to root, or login straight as root.

If you logged in as your regular user try the command:
<pre>sudo su -</pre>
Enter your local user password.

If you don't have sudo permissions but know the root password, try:
<pre>su -</pre>
Enter the root users password.

Of course logging in straight as root you don't have to do any more work.

= Make things work =
* If you are trying undionly.kpxe and this is already configured as your boot file (option 67):
<pre>cd /tftpboot
mv undionly.kpxe undionly.kpxeREAL
ln -s pxelinux.0.old undionly.kpxe</pre>
* If you want to keep troubleshooting for "other" users a little easier, change the boot file pointer back to pxelinux.0 (option 67)
<pre> cd /tftpboot
mv undionly.kpxe undionly.kpxeSOMERANDOMNAME
ln -s pxelinux.0.old pxelinux.0</pre>
* Create the pxelinux.cfg folder as it was removed.
<pre>mkdir /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg</pre>
* Create the /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default using whatever editor you desire.
<pre>vi /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default</pre>
* Code is below, change x.x.x.x to the FOG IP Address.
