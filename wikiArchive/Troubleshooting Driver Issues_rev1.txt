=== Troubleshooting Driver Issues ===

==== Method 1 ====

The first step to troubleshooting driver related issues with FOG clients is to download a live CD such as Fedora, or Ubuntu.  Boot up the CD and see if the device that wasn't functional under FOG is working with the live CD.

If it is we just need to know the kernel driver name.  This can be listed by issuing the following command:

 lspci -k

The output will look something like this:

 ...
 03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5754 Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express (rev 02)
        Kernel driver in use: tg3
        Kernel modules: tg3
 ...

In this case we know the driver required in the '''tg3''' driver for network.  You can either submit a request to the forum/feature requests section of sourceforge for this driver to be included, or see the section on building a kernel.

The first step to troubleshooting driver related issues with FOG clients is to download a live CD such as Fedora, or Ubuntu.  Boot up the CD and see if the device that wasn't functional under FOG is working with the live CD.  If it is then:

<ol>
<li>Go to http://cateee.net/sources/lkddb/</li>
<li>Download the latest version of lkddb.list.bz2</li>
<li>Go to http://cateee.net/sources/autokernconf/</li>
<li>Download the latest version of autokernconf</li>
<li>Copy both files to a directory and extract them</li>
<li>Copy lkddb.list, kdetect.sh, and autokernconf.sh to a common directory</li>
<li>cd to the common directory where the three files listed above are located.</li>
<li>run ./kdetect.sh</li>
<li>run ./autokernconf.sh</li>
<li>Then post the contents of the auto.config to the [http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=201099 FOG Forum], along with the model of computer or the device you are having issues with.  It would also be helpful to post a link to the manufactures spec page for that device.</li>
<li>If a driver exists for this device we will attempt to post an updated kernel to the '''kernel updates''' section of the FOG Management portal.</li>
