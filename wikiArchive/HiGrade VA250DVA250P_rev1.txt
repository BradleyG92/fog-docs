These HiGrade machines use a motherboard made by FIC but with a custom BIOS by HiGrade.
None of these motherboards that we have in our repair center will work with FOG at present and our suppliers confirm that the boards have the latest version of BIOS already installed (BIOS updates are not available to the general public, or our repair center so I cannot check this).

At present I would consider this not working.
