Quick reference for basic editing in vi


<pre>i</pre> = go into insert mode, here you may use arrows to navigate text, and edit it with the keyboard as normal.

Esc (the escape key) = exit insert mode

WHEN NOT in insert mode you may use:
<pre:w</pre> (then enter) = write changes.
<pre>:q</pre> (then enter) = exit vi
<pre>:q!</pre> (then enter) = exit vi without saving changes.


Examples of usage...

<pre>[root@localhost ~]# vi /README.txt</pre>

<pre>i
This is my first readme file, wrote with vi!
Esc
:w
:q</pre>

<pre>[root@localhost ~]# cat /README.txt
this is my first readme file, wrote with vi!</pre>
