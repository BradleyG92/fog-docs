error occurs when trying to network boot linux in order to upload an image:
"PCI: cannot allocate resource region 5 of device 0000:00:12.0"
I thought this might be something to do with the WLAN card but error persists even when WLAN card is disabled in bios.
After a minute or so the following message repeatedly appears:
"IP-config: reopening network devices...." 
FOG works fine on other clients on the same network.

I have a bunch of these laptop's and the fix seems to be disable PC-Card/FireWire in the BIOS.
