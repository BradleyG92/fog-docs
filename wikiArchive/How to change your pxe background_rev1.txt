It is very easy to customize your FOG server to match / reflect your place of work or taste.

====Software and config needed====

*FTP Software - [http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client] (I recommend that you use the .zip version of Filezilla so it is stand alone and portable)
*TFTP password set / reset - [[http://www.fogproject.org/wiki/index.php?title=Unable_to_connect_to_TFTP]]

You should be able to connect to your servers IP address (a.k.a. the fog server ip) and enter the default username + password.  If you can not connect please verify that you have the correct username + password set on your fog server.

By default the correct user name and password are

Username - '''fog'''

Password - '''password'''



====Steps for editing and modifying the PXE background====

* Connect to the ftp with your username and password and navigate to /tftpboot/fog directory

In this example I'm using mspaint to add TUX to the boot menu.  However you can add / remove / modify it how ever you want '''as long as you stay within the 640x480 paramaters'''

(please note that I am not trying to take credit away from Chuck Syperski or Jian Zhang.  I am just trying to show you that it is possible to tweak the PXE boot menu so it can reflect your usage)

* Upload the modified file to the same directory you downloaded it from ''/tftpboot/fog''

* PXE boot a computer and test it out! =)

Below are some examples!
