=== Bill Rice ===
Mr. Rice is a network engineer for Roxborough Memorial Hospital in Roxborough, PA. Enjoys tinkering with all things PC. Building servers, maintaining Infrastructure, WAN, WIFI, LAN, Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SQL. and is learning Linux, (prefers GUI from Mint) 

I have been toying around with FOG since build .30 I kinda got in a little late to the party. joined the forums a year later.
I had used fog personally and then introduce this software to the hospital I work for. I provided my own equipment to demonstrate the benefits to using it in our environment, only 1 drawback. I was a total Linux NOOB. I muddled through, configured the original PXE boot and the menu options. I provided my organization with a free alternative for cloning systems on the go while providing a method of booting systems that were corrupted, and recovering lost data. All this was made possible with the FOG software with special thanks to the hard and dedicated work of the founders, Chuck Syperski & Jian Zhang.
Also want to shout out to the additional members of the team for their hard work and the dedication that has provided you with many new updates and added features.

I had spent many hours of researching commands, investigating Linux distro's and have had many pleasures in troubleshooting Ubuntu changes.. lol now I'm a bit more familiar with FOG and its configs, I hope to offer up my experience and ability to seek out those problems/bugs that plague the everyday user so that the development team can fix them quickly.

Feel Free to contact me, I'll do my best to assist. As stated earlier, I'm still new to Linux but the internet is my friend :)
Good luck.
