== Groups ==
(Implimented in Fog v0.29)
*Groups can be used to mass change fog settings, image, edit snapins, service settings, active directory, and more.

*<span style="background-color:Yellow;">Group will override host settings at save only. Host settings can then be changed separately even though it is connected to a group. It matters on which is saved last.</span>

=== Creating a Group ===
*#Group Management
*#Create Group and fill in Name and Description
*#Go to Membership 
*#You will need to tick "Check here to see host not in this group".
*#Check mark the Hosts you wish to add to this group and then click "Update Hosts" at the bottom.
*Now all those Hosts are now part of that group.

== Unicast vs. Multicast vs. Torrent-Cast images==
=== Unicast ===
*Accessible from Host Management --> Select Host --> Basic Tasks
*Accessible from Group Management --> Select Group --> Basic Tasks
*Accessible from Fog iPXE Menu
*This occurs when scheduling a "Download" task, "Quick Image", or during "Full Registration" the user selects image after registration. The server (or storage node) will directly send packets (the image) to that Host's MAC address.(aka. TCP) This is excellent for directing network traffic. This can be performed under Groups running multiple unicasts to multiple hosts. However, all the hosts will not finish at exactly the same time.

=== Multicast ===
*Accessible ONLY from Group Management --> Select Group --> Basic Tasks
*This occurs when scheduling a "Multi-Cast" task from Groups. The server (or storage node) will wait for all Host computers to be network booted. Once all hosts have registered for the task the packets will be sent out out to the entire network.(aka. UDP) All hosts will download the image piece by piece all at exactly the same time and finish at the exact same time.
*[[Multicasting]]

===Torrent-Cast===
* <span style="background-color:RED; color:white;">Currently not working.</span>
*Accessible from Host Management --> Select Host --> Basic Tasks --> Advanced
*Accessible from Group Management --> Select Group --> Basic Tasks --> Advanced
*The image is broken down into chunks and indexed to create a torrent file.
*The server (or storage node) beings sending packets directly to the "first" host (TCP) once the "first" host completes a chunk it then uploads that chunk to the next host. The next host then downloads it and uploads to the next. This continues with all the chunks and hosts until the hosts have completed downloading the entire image.
