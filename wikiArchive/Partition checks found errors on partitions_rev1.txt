*Here is my initial problem:
<pre>
Error from Partimage: "Partition checks found error(s) on partitions" (Clonezilla works fine on this box though...)
Here's my filesystem layout:
/dev/hda1 is /boot
/dev/hda2 is swap
/dev/hda3 is /

An 'fsck -f /' reports no errors when I boot into single user mode,
and the box boots cleanly, yet when I setup a task to image the box in
FOG I get this error when Partimage tries to image the / filesystem.
The box is RHEL 5.3, if that makes a difference. No LVM in use, just
plain ol ext3.

Even stranger is the fact that Clonezilla (which also uses Partimage)
images and restores to the box fine

One way around this is to put a -m on the partimage command line,
telling it to ignore if already mounted.

Also, I wonder if there should not be a -M on this line also so it
will not save the MBR since you save it first anyway.

One note though is that people should specify linux as the OS type if
grub is the boot loader, even on dual boot systems. "

'''NOTE THIS IS FOR FOG VERSION .26 - they might incorporate this fix into .27'''

<pre>
cd /tftpboot/fog/images
gunzip init.gz
mkdir initmountdir
mount -o loop init initmountdir
cd initmountdir/bin
nano -w fog
</pre>

Page down to line 772 and add '-m -M' to the end of it
The line should looks like this when you're done:

<pre>/usr/local/sbin/partimage save $part $imgpart --volume=9900000000 -z1 -o -d -f3 -b -c -m -M</pre>

Page down to line 851 and add 'm -M' to that line as well

When you're done line 851 should also look like this:
<pre>/usr/local/sbin/partimage save $part $imgpart --volume=9900000000 -z1 -o -d -f3 -b -c -m -M</pre>

After editing these lines, we have to cleanup and put init.gz back where it was:

<pre>
cd ../..
umount initmountdir/
rmdir initmountdir
gzip init
</pre>

A task to image your CentOS / RHEL host should work now... that fixed it for me! [[User:Ericgearhart|Ericgearhart]] 19:17, 7 July 2009 (MST)
