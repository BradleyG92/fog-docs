== Unicast vs. Multicast vs. Torrent-cast ==
=== Unicast ===
*Accessible from Host Management --> Select Host --> Basic Tasks
*Accessible from Group Management --> Select Group --> Basic Tasks
*Accessible from Fog iPXE Menu
*This occurs when scheduling a "Download" task, "Quick Image", or during "Full Registration" the user selects image after registration. The server (or storage node) will directly send packets (the image) to that Host's MAC address.(aka. TCP) This is excellent for directing network traffic. This can be performed under Groups running multiple unicasts to multiple hosts. However, all the hosts will not finish at exactly the same time.

=== Multicast ===
*Accessible ONLY from Group Management --> Select Group --> Basic Tasks
*This occurs when scheduling a "Multi-Cast" task from Groups. The server (or storage node) will wait for all Host computers to be network booted. Once all hosts have registered for the task the packets will be sent out out to the entire network.(aka. UDP) All hosts will download the image piece by piece all at exactly the same time and finish at the exact same time.

===Torrent-cast===
*Accessible from Host Management --> Select Host --> Basic Tasks --> Advanced
