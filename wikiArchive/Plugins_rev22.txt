== Plugins ==
Plugins add more functionality to FOG. 
===== Enabling Plugins =====
Plugins are not enabled on the FOG server by default, so this is the first thing we will need to do.

#Log in to the FOG Web UI.
#Go to FOG Configuration
#Go to Fog Settings
#Scroll Down and locate the section '''Plugin System'''
#Tick on FOG_PLUGINSYS_ENABLED
#Click "Save Changes"

===LDAP Plugin===
* LDAP plugin to use a LDAP validation with FOG

==Location Plugin==
* Allows you to direct hosts at separate locations and manage through a centralized server
* Hosts will be imaged from their location setup, rather than trying to pull from a random node/server across, potentially, WAN links
* Same works for "Tftp" in that it will direct the host to get it's kernel and init from it's related location
* Can also be used to direct the host to download it's snapins from the relevant location

==Access Control Plugin==
* <span style="background-color:RED; padding: 1px"> '''NOT Currently ready''' </span>
* To give a layer of security and control over the task and imaging processes as well as limit the GUI items from "designated" controls
* For Example: IT vs. Regular User

==Capone Plugin==
Capone is a plugin for FOG that allows you to image a computer based on DMI/Hardware information without having to register it with the FOG server.  This module was originally written for a HP computer warranty service center in the UK.  They wanted to be able to restore a computer's image just by plugging it into the network and PXE booting the machine, without any user intervention.  This module is great for repair shops and places where you don't need FOG to manage the computer after it is imaged.  This is our attempt at pushing FOG into the service/repair sector.

==WOL Broadcast Plugin==
* Allowing the Fog user to specify different broadcast address on your network
* WOL will use those set values to send the WOL Packets to the broadcast addresses, rather than staying only on layer 2

==Example Plugin==
* If you would like to create your own plugins here is a template to follow.
