[http://puppylinux.org/ Puppy Linux] will boot from the fog pxe menu without too much trouble. I prefer this to DSL as it has a more modern kernel (2.6 vs DSL's 2.4) and the drivers that go along with it. DSL-N is seems to be no longer maintained, so that's not a  great option either. However, Puppy is a bit heavier than DSL, at 130M. These instructions have been tested with Puppy 5.1.1 and Fog 0.2.9 running on Ubunut 10.04.

First, download the [http://puppylinux.org/main/Download%20Latest%20Release.htm puppy iso] to your home folder, then mount it so you can get to the files inside. Note, add paths to these directions as needed.

<pre>
mkdir /tmp/puppy
mount -o loop -t iso9660 lupu-511.iso /tmp/puppy/
</pre>

So far, the only way I've found to get Puppy to PXE boot is to include the main file (sfs extension; lupu-511.sfs for Puppy 5.1.1) inside the ramdisk itself. You will need to copy the initrd.gz to a temporary folder, then embed the sfs inside it. Thanks go to jamesbond for the embedding instructions. So...

<pre>
mkdir /tmp/junk
cp /tmp/puppy/initrd.gz /tmp/junk
cp /tmp/puppy/lupu-511.sfs /tmp/junk
cd /tmp/junk
mv initrd.gz initrd.gz.old
TMPDIR=`mktemp -d XXXX`
cd $TMPDIR
zcat ../initrd.gz.old | cpio -i
cp ../lupu-511.sfs .
find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9 > ../initrd.gz
cd ..
rm -rf $TMPDIR
</pre>

Next, you need to copy the new ramdisk and the vmlinuz to a tftpboot folder, which you make.

<pre>
mkdir /tftpboot/puppy
cp /tmp/junk/initrd.gz /tftpboot/puppy
cp /tmp/puppy/vmlinuz /tftpboot/puppy
</pre>

Now update the pxelinux menu settings (in the file /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default) adding the following entry at the end:

<pre>
LABEL Puppy Linux
        KERNEL puppy/vmlinuz
        append initrd=puppy/initrd.gz
        TEXT
        Puppy Linux
        ENDTEXT
\n
</pre>

At this point, you should be done. Test it out. Do be aware that the initrd.gz will take about a minute to load (on a 100 Mb network) connection. Hope this helps someone else.
