== Setting up FOG ==

You system is now ready to login to and install the FOG Suite.

Log into Fedora using the root username and password you created during installation.

Now we must download the FOG package from sourceforge. To do this click on Applications -> Internet -> Firefox Web Browser and enter the URL http://www.sf.net/projects/freeghost. Then click on the Download link. Then click on the latest release to start the download and save the package to the /opt directory. It should be named something like fog_x.xx.fc.tar.gz

Open a terminal (Applications -> System Tools -> Terminal) and type:

<p class="code">
cd /opt<br />
tar -xvzf fog*<br />
cd fog*<br />
cd bin<br />
./installfog.sh<br />
</p>

The installer will ask you for the IP address of the server, then press enter and the installer does the rest.

After the installation has completed open Firefox again and enter the URL: http://[youripaddress]/fog/management. You will then be prompted to install the database schema.

== Testing your installation ==

After login, click on the Hosts button (single computer monitor).

Then click on the Add New Host button. Enter at least a MAC address (seperated by :) and a hostname and click the Add button.

Now click on the Tasks button (the star).

Then click on List All Hosts and find the host you just created and click on the Advanced button.

Now under Advanced Actions click on Memtest86+ and confirm that you would like to start the task.

Now click on Active Tasks and you should see the task that you just created listed.

Lastly, start the client computer that you created a task for and ensure that in BIOS, PXE boot has the highest boot priority. If everything worked correctly, you should see memtest86+ load.

Note: 
If setting a static IP does not seem to work on your Fedora 8/9 install, it might have to do with the known problem with the NetworkManager service. To remedy this, see the solution given [http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=7473903 on the Sourceforge.net help forums for FOG] and [http://www.mac-how.net/ How to for OS X users]
