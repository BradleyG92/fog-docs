*You can upgrade FOG by simply running the new install script.  It will keep all the information in the database intact like your users and passwords, host, images, tasks, etc.  It WILL overwrite DHCP settings, TFTP setttings, NFS Settings, etc.  So any customizations done to these files will have to be duplicated.

=Upgrade from ANY version of FOG to 1.3.0=

FOG 1.3.0 is not yet released as of February 2016.

FOG 1.3.0 can successfully upgrade from '''any''' prior version of FOG. Efforts have been made to preserve some web related customizations, but other services are re-configured. It's strongly suggested to try the settings that FOG sets, and then integrate any necessary customizations into what FOG sets up.
