== Requirements ==
Before diving right into the installation of FOG you need to decide which server OS you are going to use. FOG is made to install on RedHat based distro CentOS, Fedora, RHEL amongst others as well as Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux. Choose whichever you like most and have knowledge about! FOG is known to work with any of the above noted systems. [[Installation manuals]] are available for most current releases.

This listing is for informational purposes only, as the required components will be automatically downloaded and installed by the FOG installation script: PHP 5/6/7, MySql 5+, Apache 2+, DHCP (any!), TFTP, FTP, NFS

The LAMP setup can also be easily adjusted for a "WAMP (Windows Apache MySQL PHP) system" though will require a bit more knowledge of what packages to use and how to integrate with the FOG system.

== Virtualization ==
FOG can be used on bare metal as well as in most virtual server and client setups. Some of the virtualization techniques are really great when used with FOG, e.g. snapshots. Some people use virtualization to prepare and upload their "golden (master) images" all on one central location/server. Again like with the server OS we don't prefer any of the following or others that are out there. This is only a collection of hints and tricks plus maybe issues we know about.


=== Hyper-V ===
Wayne?? And that guy who found the speed issue within hyper-v kernel module (see in the forums)!


=== KVM/QEMU ===
Can be used as kind of a lightweight desktop virtual environment to test FOG and master your images.
Using this on the laptop as local test environment. Search forums and wiki but there is no valuable information about anyone using FOG on a KVM server. Asked user mxc as he seams to use it. Otherwise this will be a brief description on how to use this as I do it.

 # setup network tap device as kind of a local software switch to connect it all
 sudo tunctl -t tap0 -u <username>
 sudo ifconfig tap0 x.x.x.x netmask 255.255.255.0 up
 # generate disk image file
 qemu-img create -f qcow2 hd.qcow2 10G
 # start VM using QEMU emulator (BIOS mode)
 qemu -m 512 -boot n -net nic,vlan=1 -net tap,vlan=1,ifname=tap0,script=/bin/true -hda hd.qcow2
 # start VM using real KVM virtualization (BIOS mode)
 kvm -m 512 -boot n -net nic,vlan=1,macaddr=00:00:00:00:00:05 -net tap,vlan=1,ifname=tap0,script=/bin/true -hda hd.qcow2
 # start VM as UEFI machine - as well using the more modern '-netdev' parameter
 kvm -m 512 -boot n -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=hn0 -netdev tap,id=hn0,ifname=tap0,script=/bin/true -hda hd.qcow2


=== Proxmox/OpenVZ ===
Remember the NFS kernel settings that were needed to be able to run FOG server within OpenVZ

=== VirtualBox ===
Bridged network, host only. Older versions have (PXE?) bug - Tom knows about that.

=== VMWare ESXi ===
George is using it AFAIK - will ask him.

=== VMWare Player ===
Is this still in use?? Don't care if there is nothing about it in wiki or forums!

=== Xen/XenServer ===
See forums

* [[Ubuntu and OpenVZ]]
* [[Running pre-built virtual machines in Virtualbox|FOG 0.30 VM - Virtualbox]]
* [[Installation on VMWare 0.27|FOG 0.27 VM - VMWare]]

== Security ==
Firewalld
iptables
SELinux


== Troubleshooting ==
IMPORTANT, what to do when the installer fails? Where are the logs?
