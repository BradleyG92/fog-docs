== TFTP's roles in FOG ==

TFTP is used to download the boot-file specified by either DHCP or ProxyDHCP. TFTP is very simple and has very little protections in place; Generally read-only is preferred for files offered by TFTP, however full permissions will work too. Normally, the boot-files for FOG are located in /tftpboot   Generally, TFTP offers [http://fogproject.org/wiki/index.php/Filename_Information these boot files].

== Testing TFTP ==



=== Try to get a file with Linux: ===

This is ran from a separate Linux machine, NOT your FOG server.

Normally, you can use your Linux installation medium to live boot on another computer.

<pre>tftp -v x.x.x.x -c get undionly.kpxe
Connected to x.x.x.x (x.x.x.x), port 69
getting from x.x.x.x:undionly.kpxe to undionly.kpxe [netascii]
Received 89509 bytes in 0.0 seconds [84047115 bit/s]
</pre>

=== Try to get a file with Windows: ===

<pre>tftp –i x.x.x.x get undionly.kpxe</pre>

==== Testing using Windows ====
{{:Windows_TFTP}}

=== FOG 0.32 and Below ===

To test TFTP on 0.32 and below, you need to try to get the pxelinux.0 file instead of undionly.kpxe
You may use the above Linux & Windows methods, but simply replace the file name with pxelinux.0

For example:

'''Windows'''

<pre>tftp –i x.x.x.x get pxelinux.0</pre>

'''Linux'''

<pre>tftp -v x.x.x.x -c get pxelinux.0</pre>

== TFTP Service ==

=== Fedora 20/21 === 

status/enable/restart
<pre>systemctl status xinetd.service
systemctl enable xinetd.service
systemctl restart xinetd.service</pre>

=== Ubuntu ===

newer systems:

status/enable/restart
<pre>service tftpd-hpa status
service tftpd-hpa restart
service tftpd-hpa enable</pre>

older systems:

status/enable/restart
<pre>sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd status
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd enable</pre>

== FOG Configuration (web interface) ==

x.x.x.x/fog/management -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> TFTP Server ->  

Ensure that the below settings are set to a local FOG linux user that actually exists. Ensure correct password is provided. Ensure that the supplied user has permission to the /tftpboot directory (see permissions).

== Disable & Verify Firewall ==
{{:Disable & Verify Firewall}}


It's necessary to disable the Windows firewall when using windows for testing. The below image demonstrates disabling the firewall which allows TFTP traffic to pass.

== Permissions ==

Check permissions on /tftpboot directory by using:
<pre>ls -laR /tftpboot</pre>

Set permissions to allow everyone full access to /tftpboot and all contents:
<pre>chmod -R 777 /tftpboot</pre>

See example permissions below:

==Check Network Switch settings==
See [[IPXE]] for network switch settings concerning STP/portfast/etc.

{{:DHCP_Settings}}

== Troubleshooting ==

Using DHCP or ProxyDHCP, you can capture the packets sent to and from a particular host using TCPDump.

{{:TCPDump}}


Using the above method and filter, this is what a '''BROKEN''' Option 067 (or ProxyDHCP) conversation '''might''' look like:

[[File:Broken dnsmasq.png]]

In this case, DHCP (or dnsmasq) boot file name is not configured correctly, the boot file does not exist, or TFTP is not configured properly.

== Common problems and fixes ==


=== My problem isn't in the WiKi! ===

{{:My problem isn't in the WiKi!}}



=== Failed to load libcom32.c32  /  Failed to load COM32 file vesamenu.c32 ===

==== Description ====

You see a rolling error that says:
<pre>Failed to load libcom32.c32
Failed to load COM32 file vesamenu.c32</pre>

And the host won't boot to the network.

==== Solution ====

This error has been seen in FOG Trunk (r3500s), and could possibly occur in 1.2.0 also.

This is caused by DHCP option 067 being set to pxelinux.0

Some people have large DHCP scopes set. Sometimes a higher-up global scope/setting can override local scope settings for a particular site.

Whatever the case, DHCP is indeed handing out pxelinux.0 and that's generally not advised.

For ProxyDHCP users (dnsmasq), you should look to see what boot file is being handed out. 

For those that have inherited / upgraded a FOG server and are trying to use standard DHCP for 066 and 067, it's possible that ProxyDHCP might be running on your FOG server, and it's possible that ProxyDHCP is re-setting 067 on your network hosts to an incorrect value of pxelinux.0 which would cause this error.

You should use either undionly.kpxe or undionly.kkpxe for BIOS booting for option 067, or use any of the .efi files inside of /tftpboot for UEFI booting.

Please see this article for more details about the various boot files available in fog: [[Filename Information]]

=== Unable to connect to tftp server ===

==== For Versions Before 0.24 ====


This seems to be caused by a password issue,

 1. From the fog management interface, go to users.
 2. Reset the fog user password.
 3. Click the "I" icon - "Other Information"
 4. Click "Fog Settings" in the menu on the left
 5. Replace the FOG_TFTP_FTP_PASSWORD and the FOG_NFS_FTP_PASSWORD fields under FOG settings with 
    your Linux fog user password. (Seems like FOG_NFS_FTP_PASSWORD is gone for ver .24).

==== For Versions .24-.32 ====

*Reset the local password for user fog with:  [sudo] passwd fog
*In management front end, go to '''Storage Management''' -> '''All Storage Nodes'''
*Click on '''DefaultMember'''
*Change the '''Management Password''' to match the password you just changed.
*Then go to '''Other Information''' and change '''FOG_TFTP_FTP_PASSWORD''' also.


* Go to your fog web location, on Red Hat and CentOS is in:
 /var/www/html/fog/

Then open the file:
 /commons/config.php

and check the values of:
'''TFTP_FTP_PASSWORD''' and '''STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD'''

These '''MUST''' match the password you set above, if not write them properly in here

Finally reload of the service

 /etc/init.d/vsftpd reload

----
==== Verify Server Settings ====

If you have modified your server setup since first install, then the new changes must be updated and verified in the '''Fog Settings''' menu. 
It might not be enough to just re-run the installer.
For instance, a new IP lease will cause the server to show the '''Unable to connect to tftp server''' error message.

* Go to the "I" icon, which is the '''About''' menu in 0.29
* Select '''Fog Settings''' and navigate down to '''TFTP Settings''' and verify that all options are correct for your setup.

==== Ensure nothing else on the network is conflicting with the DHCP server ====

I had this error the past two days and tried all of the standard suggestions. Finally Wireshark came to the rescue. I discovered a second, feral DHCP server on the network that wasn't issuing IP addresses but must have been running interference somehow. When I disconnected it from the network, PXE boot worked as expected.
