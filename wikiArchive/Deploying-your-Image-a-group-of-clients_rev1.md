(Implimented in Fog v0.29)

-   Groups can be used to mass change fog settings, image, edit snapins,
    service settings, active directory, and more.
-   Group will override host settings at save only.
-   `<span style="background-color:Yellow;">`{=html}Host settings can
    then be changed separately even though it is connected to a group.
    It matters on which is saved last.`</span>`{=html}
