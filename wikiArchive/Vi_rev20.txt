Quick reference for basic editing in vi


i = go into insert mode, here you may use arrows to navigate text, and edit it with the keyboard as normal.
Esc (the escape key) = exit insert mode

WHEN NOT in insert mode you may use
:w (then enter) = write changes.
:q (then enter) = exit vi
:q! (then enter) = exit vi without saving changes.


Examples of usage...

<pre>[root@localhost ~]# vi /README.txt</pre>

<pre>i
This is my first readme file, wrote with vi!
Esc
:w
:q</pre>

<pre>[root@localhost ~]# cat /README.txt
this is my first readme file, wrote with vi!</pre>
