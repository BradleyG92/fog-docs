== Restoring FOG ==

Restoring a FOG installation requires essentially the opposite actions as taken above.  This section assumes you backed your installation up manually.  This section will assume that your backup is in /opt/fog_backup.  Also, you may need to be root for some of these actions.

First, go to your backup directory:
 # cd /opt/fog_backup
 # ls
 fogopt fog.sql web
As you can see, I have named my /opt/fog into fogopt, and my /var/www/fog into web.  I chose not to backup my /images directory due to some issues copying such large files.

=== Web Directory ===

Restoring your web directory will take two steps.  First, remove the current one, if it exists, then copy the backup over to the appropriate location.
 # rm -rf /var/www/fog
 # cp -a /opt/fog_backup/web /var/www/fog

=== OPT Directory ===

Restoring the /opt directory is just about the same as the web directory above.
 # rm -rf /opt/fog
 # cp -a /opt/fog_backup/fogopt /opt/fog

=== MySQL Databse ===

In order to restore the database, you should first drop the current one (if it exists), then create a blank fog database, then import your backup.
 # mysql -u root -p
 Enter password: 
 mysql> DROP DATABASE fog;
 mysql> CREATE DATABASE fog;
 mysql> exit
 # mysql -D fog -u root -p < fog.sql

That should do it!
