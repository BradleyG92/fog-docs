Normally, to get to the FOG web interface, you have to type
<pre>x.x.x.x/fog/management</pre>

This works fine, but if FOG is the '''only''' thing your Linux box is running, you can simplify this with a redirect so that simply typing the x.x.x.x into a web browser takes you to the FOG login page.


'''Fedora'''

On your FOG server, we will create a file called index.php using vi.

<pre>vi /var/www/html/index.php</pre>

in here, you'd write (or copy/paste) this:

<pre><?php header('Location: http://x.x.x.x/fog/management/index.php'); ?>
die();</pre>

Save this file.

Now, when you go to x.x.x.x you'll be taken to the FOG login screen! How cool is that?!?
