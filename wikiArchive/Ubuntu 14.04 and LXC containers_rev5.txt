Ubuntu releases after 10.04 LTS do no longer provide unfs3. Unfs3 is useful when one want to setup a fog server in a container with OpenVZ or LXC. Nfs kernel server cannot run in these containers.

= Prerequisites =

* A computer (physical or virtual) running Ubuntu 14.04 Server, may or may not using LVM, with available space in at least one volume group

= Network setup on the LXC host =

Setup a bridge on the computer, with at least one ethernet interface attached to it.

apt-get install bridgeutils

edit the file '''/etc/network/interfaces''' and add the following lines. '''Please ensure you're not using a SSH session''', because you may lose your connection !

Add the following lines :
auto br0
iface br0 inet static
address 192.168.1.2
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
bridge_ports eth0
bridge_fd 0
bridge_maxwait 0

Reboot the computer and check network connectivity

= LXC container creation =

First, create a LXC container running Ubuntu. The version is the latest LTS version available at the moment of creating the container

  lxc-create -n server-fog -t ubuntu -B lvm --vgname vg --lvname lv-server-fog --fssize=10G --fstype=ext4

This will create a logical volume '''lv-server-fog''' in the volume group '''vg0''', with a 10GB ext4 filesystem. The container wil be named '''server-fog'''. At the end of the process, the system will give you a login and a password.

Edit the file '''/var/lib/lxc/server-fog/config''' and setup networking for the container :
  
  lxc.network.link = br0
  lxc.network.ipv4 = 192.168.1.3
  lxc.network.gateway = 192.168.1.1

start your container 

  lxc-start -n server-fog -F

login with the login and password given earlier, and '''change the password''' ! If needed, you have to shutdown the container to go back to the host's console

  sudo init 0

To run the container non interactively, use the following command 

  lxc-start -d -n server-fog

To use a terminal in the container :

  lxc-console -n server-fog

You may exit the container at any time using the following keys (do not forget to logout first, because this will NOT logout any user in the container) : 
  
  CTRL+A, Q

In the container you have to download, compile and install unfs3 from sources.

* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/unfs3/files/ Download unfs3]
* decompress the archive : tar zxf unfs3-0.9.22.tar.gz
* apt-get install build-essential make flex bison
* cd unfs3-0.9.22
* ./configure
* make
* make install
* make install-init
* edit /etc/init.d/unfsd and replace the occurence of /usr/sbin/unfsd with /usr/local/sbin/unfsd
* /etc/init.d/unfsd start
* check unfsd is running : ps -ef | grep unfsd
* if it runs, then run update-rc.d unfsd defaults

Install and configure fog as usual.

If you want to setup a separate volume for your images :

* assuming you want to use a logical volume (LVM) /dev/vg0/lv with a ext3 filesystem :
* run your container and move all files located in /images into an other location (/root/images-bak), including the hidden file /images/.mntcheck
* from the lxc host, open /var/lib/your-container/fstab and add the following line : /dev/vg0/lv images ext3 defaults 0 0
* restart the container, and check the nex volume is available : run mount without any argument.
* If the LVM volume has been successfully mounted, move back the files backed up in /root/images-bak. Note there is no slash before '''images'''.
* chmod 777 /images
