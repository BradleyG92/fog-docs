Inside the FOG DB, there are two multicast association tables. You can delete all the rows in those tables, re-install FOG, and try again and see what happens?

Via MySQL cli

<pre>TRUNCATE TABLE multicastSessions; 
TRUNCATE TABLE multicastSessionsAssoc; 
DELETE FROM tasks WHERE taskTypeId=8;</pre>
