== Setup and Installation ==

This is a quick guide to perform a full installation.  This is not fully inclusive, but should help all out as possible.

# Insert your CentOs 6.4 installation disc and reboot the computer. You will be presented with a few options, install CentOS. Select the “Install or upgrade an existing system” Option when it is presented to you at the Welcome screen.
# Proceed with a normal install of CentOS, it is a good idea to test your installation media but you may skip this step if you like. After the CentOS logo appears, click Next.
# Select a language that is easy to understand, click next. Choose a corresponding keyboard layout, click next.
# Choose the type of installation, Basic Storage Devices will suffice. Click Next.
# Set the host name of the computer, and set the static ip of the machine if you would like to.
##Click Configure Network
##Select Wired and click Options.
##Select the “IPV4 Settings” tab.
##Change the method from Automatic to Manual.  Then Add, and supply the server with a proper IP address and information.
##Check the automatic connection box.
##Click Save.
##Click Next.
# Set your time zone, Click Next.
# Set a root password, click Next.
# Disk partitioning, it would be a good idea to use the entire disk for the new linux OS, you may change the option if you have a previous OS and want to keep it. Click Next.
# Finally choose the type of Installation to be performed.
# Click Next and CentOS will install, after installation remove the installation media and reboot.

== After Login ==

There are a few preliminary steps to be aware of in CentOS.  We need to update the system and disable selinux and iptables.  If you need iptables or selinux, look in the forums for assistance.

# Get to a terminal or console and sign in as root.
# In the terminal type:
<pre>sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/sysconfig/selinux
sed -i 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/' /etc/selinux/config
service iptables stop
chkconfig iptables off
yum -y update && reboot</pre>

These steps will first disable selinux.  Then will stop the firewall, and disable it from starting on boot.  Then it will update and reboot the system.

Now on to repository additions.

== Repositories ==

Once CentOS is installed, to install FOG you need a couple of third part repositories.  RPMForge will be needed for htmldoc, and it wouldn't hurt to include the ELREPO and and EPEL repositories.  For compatibilities sake, we're going to install the remi repository as well to ensure php gets installed at the latest version.

=== 32 Bit System ===
# Get to a terminal or console and sign in as root.
# In the terminal type:
<pre>rpm --import http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6
rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

=== 64 Bit System ===
# Get to a terminal or console and sign in as root.
# In the terminal type:
<pre>rpm --import http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-6

rpm --import http://rpms.famillecollet.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-remi
rpm -Uvh http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-6.rpm</pre>

* Now perform installation of some needed packages.
<pre>yum -y install htmldoc ttf2pt1 t1utils fltk subversion wget</pre>

You should now be ready for FOG installation.  Though many of the things will be automatically installed, we just helped the system ensure they're available when you actually perform the install script.

== FOG Installation ==
Your system should now be prepared to install fog.

=== Download FOG ===
# Get to a terminal or console and sign in as root.
# In the terminal type:
#*You will find the latest "Stable" release of FOG here '''[http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/files/latest/download?source=files sourceforge]'''
#*You can also update to the latest "Beta". Please see [[Upgrade_to_trunk]]
'''FOR EXAMPLE: '''
<pre>cd ~
svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/freeghost/code/tags/0.32 fog_0.32
cd fog_0.32/bin</pre>

=== Install FOG ===
<pre>
./installfog.sh</pre>
