== Computer Ressources Center, Université Rennes 2, FRANCE ==

Here at the Université Rennes 2, (a 17000 + students, liberal Arts public institution based in Rennes, Bretagne, FRANCE) we've been using FOG since february 2009.
Change of imaging solution was taken, essentialy for the  web based functionnality of FOG and the reuse of our previous development work.  Thanks to the FOG linux-based kernel, this change was completed in only two months. We really  appreciate the efficiency of FOG particularly the multi-cast functionnality for classroom deployement ( 230 stations, 14 classrooms) 

Thanks you so much for creating such a powerful and evolutive tool, precious for public institutions like ours
Keep up the good work.

The "Micro" team, at the Computer Ressource Center

== Taminmin College, NT, Australia ==

Taminmin College ICT Services began evaluating the FOG project in January 2009. Over the time we have moved from using FOG for booting each client via GPXE on CD/USB due to requirements with our upstream SCCM service to now in June 2010 being able to successfully migrate away from the upstream service and deploy DHCPD on CentOS 5 to allow for complete network management of our desktops and laptops. By moving FOG over to our primary workstation management solution we have gone from needing two weeks to overhaul our IT labs to having the job complete within 2 days. This has been primarily due to increased speed in downloading the image and Active Directory integration.

ICT Services staff also maintain an active interest in contributing to the FOG project where possible.

== Theo Thijssenschool, Kindergarten and Elementary School, Netherlands ==

This is a small school located in The Netherlands in a village called Waddinxveen.
We are very, very happy with FOG, altough it's a small school and network, using FOG saves us very much time!
Without FOG we had to quit for sure and the school had to hire a payed IT service, as the school has a very small budget, this would be a bad thing!
The school IT services are done by TuxBrothers.net for free, this is a OpenSource community with volenteers for working at school in spare time.
At school we use two "master" images with all software and all profiles on board.
So we only have to manage two computers and the rest is done by FOG. 
On the server side we are running on 3 Linux (CentOS) machines and clients are all win xp.

Since our proprietary imaging software was outdated we decided to test FOG, and it perfectly fulfills our needs. We image about 100 clients in unicast as well as multicast mode. On server side we are running Ubuntu Server 9.04 (FOG) and Debian Lenny (DHCP) for imaging. Thank you for this great software!

== San Juan National High School, Philippines ==

My name is Sean Stanhill and I am a Peace Corps volunteer (Education) at a provincial school in San Juan, Philippines. We have a lab that was donated by the Intel Corporation, Philippines and FOG specifically has met our needs by have a uniform installation. It used to take my Filipino counterpart and I 4.5 hours per machine to install Windows (genuine licenses came with each unit) and all of the software we required for lessons an productivity. FOG has cut that time down immensely. I just got the server up and running and I had 5 machines done in 25 minutes, a fraction of the time it took before. Having uniform installations also means that instead of wasting class time troubleshooting, detracting time away from teaching and learning, we an re-image the offending machine in 10-15 minutes and have it back up and running for the student. This is a perfect solution for schools in developing countries who are lucky enough to have a lab. Thank you, to the creators, for your time and efforts. They are so appreciated.

We are a special education school district with many different buildings all over the South Chicago Land area.We have a large range of Desktops and Laptops used within the district. As computers break down and are purchased, we make sure to build an image of that model for future use. To do this we built a small form factor desktop that is easily portable and has loads of storage space. It's running Ubuntu 9.04. Combined with a KVM and a 12 port switch We are easily able to run too every building with the fog server and image anything we need too quite fast. Fog has also proven it's self with multicasting up too 8 machines at once. 8 only because that's all we could fit on the table! The last year, fog has made life easier as administrators. Though it's an ongoing learning process. At time's it can be frustrating when trying to build a good image and push the image out correctly. We find 80% of the time there is an error it is because of a setting that was missed turning off or on in the bios of the pc. REMEMBER TOO DEFRAG WINDOWS BEFORE YOU UPLOAD THE IMAGE TOO FOG!!

At department of Cheminical and Biological Enigeering of UBC, we've been using Synmentec Ghost Enterprise 8 for years to image 100 computers in our lab every school year. A few month ago, one of the systems administrators mentioned FOG in our mailing list, we started to look into this image cloning solutions. Following the instructions of FOG User Guide on this wiki site, we built a FOG server on a CentOS 5 distribution . Though there was a TFTP connection issue caused by SELINUX, we finally tested image uploading and multicasting. The web management interface is awesome and impressive, especially the smart way to join hosts to a group by search strings is very usefull. Many other features like joining host to domain, wake up on LAN, Snapins are far more advanced than Synmentec Ghost. We appreciate all your hard work that brings the most simple and efficient image cloning solution to the IT world. Well done!

== Henry County Public Schools, Henry County, VA USA ==

We stumbled upon FOG a couple of years ago and were skeptical. We set up a test server and after a little trial and error, got an image successfully uploaded and deployed. Now FOG is used daily by a team of 6 technicians. It has cut our time spent on troubleshooting, installation, deployment, etc, in half. We use FOG for imaging, snapins, and printer management. This system has taken a lot of the legwork out of all of our jobs. 

We have one server on our network, but use several "mobile" FOG servers installed on laptops for large labs and computers in other buildings. We set the mobile servers' configurations identical to the main server so that the FOG client works whether they are on a small LAN connected to the mobile server, or on the main network. 

Thanks so much for a wonderful product.

We found FOG three years ago. We have created a vmware image to test and after only 6 months we have adopted as our immaging solution. FOG now has migrated to a real server and is used by our 3 technicians. Last year we organized a course on FOG for all technicians of the schools of Reggio Emilia. A great success! Today we are focusing on the use of snapins to customize the machines after deploying a base image developed with vmware player.
Thanks to developers for an ingenious product.

Our initial test with FOG was to see if we could avoid purchasing more licenses for our previous imaging solution.  So far it’s working well.  We are currently using FOG to maintain a small community lab of 16 desktop computers.  We have used the hostname changer and join domain features with success.  If all goes well, FOG will possibly be used to manage the rest of our workstations.  Thank you for the simple and very capable product.
