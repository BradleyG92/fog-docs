## Contributing to the FOG Project {#contributing_to_the_fog_project}

If you use and/or like FOG and would like to help the project evolve
there are many ways to do so. Please see the following list for ways in
which you can aid in the development of FOG.

-   `<b>`{=html}Report Bugs`</b>`{=html} - Bug reports are very
    important to us! If you encounter an error that isn\'t in the Bug
    Tracker please report it, this helps us make a better and more
    stable product.
-   `<b>`{=html}Add to or Create a wiki page`</b>`{=html} - We are not
    very good at documentation, so if you see a spelling mistake or a
    grammar issue and want to fix it please do. Also if you feel that
    the documentation is missing something and would like to add it we
    would love it if you did!
-   `<b>`{=html}Make a feature request`</b>`{=html} - If you think there
    is something missing from FOG that you would like to see added, you
    probably are not the only one that could use it, make a feature
    request and we will try to add it to FOG.
-   `<b>`{=html}Code`</b>`{=html} - If you know a little programming and
    think something is sloppy or could be done better, pass it along. Or
    if you want to or have added a new feature to FOG that isn\'t part
    of the core package let us know and we will attempt to include
    it[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor)
-   `<b>`{=html}Spread the Word`</b>`{=html} - Submit an objective
    article about FOG to a web based publication, or just mention FOG to
