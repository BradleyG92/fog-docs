If your capture and deployment seem to be particularly slow, and things were faster on a previous version of FOG, you may want to lower the compression effort: less effort means less compression, but may end up being faster.

Do this by changing the FOG_PIGZ_COMP setting (9 in FOG 1.0.0 and later, but 3 in earlier versions). You find this under FOG Settings, FOG Boot Settings..

*Update*
Recommended compression setting is 7, and will be the default in FOG 1.3.0. You must re-capture an image in order for it to be re-compressed. Compression settings in FOG 1.3.0 can be set per-image, but the global default still exists in FOG Settings.
