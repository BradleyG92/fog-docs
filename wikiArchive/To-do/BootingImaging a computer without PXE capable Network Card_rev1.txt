=== Booting/Imaging a computer without PXE capable Network Card  ===

Not all Computers can Networkboot. So the guys from http://www.etherboot.org compiled a tool called gPXE for that reason.

Its very handy to use: 
*Just download the actual version. 
*Run the Make program and use 'dd' to copy it to a floppy. 
For our Workgroup here in University it works with every old PC. 
You find a HowTo for creating disks and usb-sticks at http://etherboot.org/wiki/removable

If you plan on making a boot CD, on fedora you will need to install the following:  syslinux mtools

 yum install syslinux mtools
