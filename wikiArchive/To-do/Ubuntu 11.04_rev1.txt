== Known (FOG) version issues ==
=== FOG 0.31 ===
==== dhcp3-server to isc-dhcp-server ====

With Ubuntu 11.04, the standard dhcp package was changed to isc-dhcp-server. FOG 0.31 only looks for isc-dhcp-server (this was fixed in .32), therefore to use FOG version .31  with Ubuntu 11.04 you will need to edit the following files:

<pre>/opt/fog_0.31/lib/ubuntu/config.sh</pre>
