== Upgrading the FOG Server ==

'''It is highly recommended that you backup your data before you perform the upgrade.'''

Upgrading from one version of FOG to a newer version is as easy as running the installer for the new version of FOG.  It will update your system while leaving your data in place.

Remember install settings are in <install directory>/fog/.fogsettings.  If anything has changed since the last install make updates to .fosettings before running the install.

FOG will '''NOT''' modify:

*Any modified reports
*Image Files
*All database settings

FOG '''WILL''' modify:

*Any Custom changes to php/init.gz file.
*Any changes to dhcpd.conf.
*Any changes to  /etc/xinetd.d/tftp.
*Any changes to /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.
*Any changes to /etc/exports.
*Any changes to php config files on /var/www/fog and /opt/fog
