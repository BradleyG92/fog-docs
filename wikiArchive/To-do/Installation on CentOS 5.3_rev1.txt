== CentOS 5.3 ==

===Known Issues===

Some packages are unavailable, causing an error during the installer script.  Follow the instructions below to install them so the script runs properly.

===Installing CentOS===
*Download the CentOS 5.3 CD1.
*Boot into graphical install mode
*After the media check, the GUI installer will come up
*Select Language & Keyboard
*Select the desired partitioning configuration
*Setup IP networking.
*Set Timezone
*Select root password
*At the software packages section, you must uncheck Desktop-Gnome, then select "Customize Now".
**Unselect Base/Dialup Networking Support
**Unselect Applications/Text-Based Internet
*Proceed with the install & reboot when prompted.

====Post Installation Tasks====

On first boot, a setup section appears.  Run the Firewall configuration.

*For a basic configuration, set security level to Disabled, and SELinux to Disabled.

===Setting up FOG on CentOS===
====Installing on 0.26====
*download/scp the fog installer to the /root folder of your CentOS server.
*Install yum-priorities
 yum install yum-priorities

*Download the current RPMForge for your system from http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/ or another repository
*Install rpmforge
 rpm -i rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm

*Extract FOG
 tar -xvzf fog_0.26.tar.gz

*Fix the Path to include files used by the FOG Installer 
 PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin:/sbin

*launch the installer
 cd fog_0.26/bin
 ./installfog.sh
*Go through the install script, selecting Fedora
*The rest of the install is identical to the Fedora section now.

'''If you get an error of:   * Starting FOG Multicast Management Server...Failed! then just re-launch the installer & it will work the second time through'''

====Installing on 0.27====
The installer is more CentOS friendly with 0.27.  The only piece missing is RPMForge, so htmldoc can be seamlessly installed.
*Download the current RPMForge for your system from http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/ or another repository
*Install rpmforge
 rpm -i rpmforge-release-0.3.6-1.el5.rf.i386.rpm

You can now do a regular install.

==CentOS 5.4==

The Fedora installer works without issue for CentOS install, assuming use of CentOS 5.4 (32 bit only tested).

==CentOS 5.5==

====Installing 0.29 and 0.30====
Issues:

(1) On CentOS 5.5, RPMForge is still required for htmldoc to work.

(2) The package of php-gettext does not exist on CentOS.  It is a part of the base PHP package.  You will need to edit /fog_0.29/lib/redhat/config.sh & remove php-gettext from the packages list on line 22

(3) Checking Package ClamAV-Update fails.  On CentOS the package is called clamav.  The config file specifies clamav-update.  Edit /fog_0.29/lib/redhat/config.sh & change clamav-update to clamav.

(4) Configuring Fresh Clamcp:cannot start `/etc/sysconfig/freshclam': No such file or directory...Failed!  (Will need to change location of config file in /fog_0.29/lib/redhat/config.sh to match, should be `/usr/bin/freshclam')


Solution:


*Download the current RPMForge for your system from http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/ or another repository

*Install rpmforge

 rpm -i rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.i386.rpm


Edit 'fog_0.29/lib/redhat/config.sh' *prior to* executing 'fog_0.29/bin/installfog.sh'.

- Edit line 22 as mentioned in (2) and (3) above (remove 'php-gettext' and change 'clamav-update' to 'clamav')

- Edit line 63 to read: 'freshDB="/var/clamav/";

- Edit line 66 to read: 'freshcron="/usr/sbin/freshclam"


(Tested with CentOS 5.5 32-bit, fog 029, and rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.i386.rpm)

(Tested with CentOS 5.5 64-bit, fog 030, and rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el5.rf.x86_64.rpm)


==CentOS 5.6==


====Installing 0.30====

The changes above still apply to CentOS 5.6.


====Installing 0.31====

Version 0.31 now requires PHP-5.2.1+ to handle new features in the web interface.  See the [http://wiki.iuscommunity.org/Doc/ClientUsageGuide IUS Repo Wiki] on how to upgrade to either PHP-5.2 or PHP-5.3.

Thus far all other requirements / changes are the same.

====Installing 0.32====

Version 0.31 now requires PHP-5.2.1+ to handle new features in the web interface.  See the [http://wiki.iuscommunity.org/Doc/ClientUsageGuide IUS Repo Wiki] on how to upgrade to either PHP-5.2 or PHP-5.3.

*When you install CentOS do not install any version of PHP instead:
**Edit the /fog_0.29/lib/redhat/config.sh file and change any reference of "php" to "php53"  (this will install PHP-5.3 during the FOG install)
***When the FOG installation is completed, you'll need to edit the /etc/php.ini file
****Add the following to line 2 (choose your own timezone [http://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php here]):
 date.timezone = "America/Chicago"
