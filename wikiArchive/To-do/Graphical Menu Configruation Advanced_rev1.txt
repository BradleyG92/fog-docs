==How to change the font size / color of the PXE boot menu==

It's very easy to edit the graphical pxe menu of the FOG server.  You can change everything from the background color [[Link title]] to the font color / size, and even add additional pieces of software you can boot from.


===Modify your default file from your server===
You can also edit and modify the default menu file directly on your FOG server.  This file is located in the '''/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg''' folder. <br>
::''Note that this file, along with your customized edits, will be overwritten by FOG if the PXE boot menu is updated through the web interface.'' 


Open the default file in your favorite text editor.  You are going to want to modify the file to adjust the menu color title and the default font color.  Please note that font color and menu color are controlled similar to what you would see in HTML based coding.

<pre>   DEFAULT vesamenu.c32
   MENU TITLE FOG Computer Cloning Solution
   MENU BACKGROUND fog/bg.png
   MENU MASTER PASSWD $1$K8Vl0MRF$IeRczmyo1X3EH3Zf5aEcH0
   
   menu color title	1;36;44    #ffffffff #00000000 std</pre>

By default #ffffffff = white

By default #00000000 = black


If you feel inclined, you can also change what is displayed at the top of the menu as well.  Even though FOG is registered under GPL 3, I am going to suggest that you include some credit for Chuck Syperski / etc.

Here is a list of other color elements you may wish to change

 pwdentry        Password box contents
 timeout_msg     Timeout message
 timeout         Timeout counter
 help		 Help text

e.g 
 menu color unsel 1;36;44    #fc0000 #00000000 std
will change the color of your menu items to red
