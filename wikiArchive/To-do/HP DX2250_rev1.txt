In order to create an image from, or restore an image to an HP DX2250 computer you'll need to change the SATA settings in the system CMOS.

<ol>
<li>Enter the system CMOS by pressed F9 as the system boots</li>
<li>Under 'Advanced' change the SATA emulation mode from Legacy IDE to Standard IDE</li>
<li>FOG will now detect your hard drive and partitions properly</li>
</ol>
