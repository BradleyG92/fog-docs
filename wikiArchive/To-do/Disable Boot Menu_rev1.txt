Doing the below steps will prevent the boot menu from showing, or loading. FOG continues to run. If Network Booting is tried before HDD, the computer will still attempt to boot to the network. If there is an active task for this computer, FOG will carry out those tasks (the menu is not necessary for this). The menu can easily be turned back on for Registration.
