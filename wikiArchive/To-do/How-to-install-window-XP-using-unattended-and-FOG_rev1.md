# Overview

THIS WALKTHROUGH IS NOT COMPLETE

This guide will show you how to install and configure
[Unattended](http://www.unattended.sourceforge.net) to work with
[FOG](http://www.fogproject.org).\
This is helpful when you want to install Windows XP (or 2000 or 2003
server) by using an installer rather than an image. (such as in a repair
shop environment)
