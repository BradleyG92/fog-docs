At this time there is only one easy method to accomplish this and it is SVN.
Git provides a method to upgrade to a specific revision, but it's not as user friendly.

==SVN==
*Install as seen in '''[[SVN]]'''
<pre>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/freeghost/code/trunk /some/local/folder</pre>

*Then navigate to the folder you specified and run:

<pre>sudo /some/local/folder/bin/./installfog.sh</pre>

====Update to Revision====
<pre>cd  /some/local/folder/
svn up -r <revision>
cd bin
./installfog.sh</pre>

*''NOTE:'' You must run '''svn up -r <revision>''' in the "/some/local/folder/" and not in ".../fog/bin" nor in ".../fog"
*<span style="background-color:RED; color:yellow;">WARNING: DO NOT DOWN GRADE! If you do, the mysql database will be messed up and a <u>possible</u> re-installation will be your only hope.</span>
