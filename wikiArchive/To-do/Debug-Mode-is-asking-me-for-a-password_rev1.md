The FOG installer sets in invalid/unknown password for debug mode
because the potential power it would give to the end user. So if you
would like to access debug mode, you must set a password by performing
the following steps:

1.  Login to the Web UI
2.  Go to **other information** (the \'i\' icon)
3.  Select **PXE Boot Menu**
4.  Enter at least a Master Password as well as a password for any other
    resource you would like to protect.
5.  Click **Save PXE Menu**
