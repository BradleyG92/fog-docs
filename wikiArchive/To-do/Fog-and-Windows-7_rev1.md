**Fog Client:** The FOG client downloaded off of my fog server fails to
install with an error about it being unsafe and that the Administrator
should be contacted to put the install into Basic mode.

Running my EXE that was built with installrite crashes and then the
configuration cannot be written because the directory isn\'t setup
correctly.
