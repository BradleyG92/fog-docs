==HP Procure Multicast Configuration==

=== Overview ===

====Components Used====
#Fog server running version 0.30
#HP ProCurve 5406zl (core layer 3 router)
#HP ProCurve 4108   (building layer 2 Switch)
#HP ProCurve 2520   (layer 2 Switch on my desk)
#2 PCs

====Setup====
#3 Subnets (and VLANs) one for servers and two for students/staff
#FOG server on vlan 1 with IP address 192.168.19.77 - connected to the 5406zl
#2 PCs on vlan 4 with IP address lease from DHCP (192.168.18.x) NOT from FOG server - connected to the 2520

====Procuve Router Commands - Layer 3====
commands here are modified extracts of http://cdn.procurve.com/training/Manuals/3500-5400-6200-6600-8200-MRG-Mar10-K_14_52.pdf page 3-20

connect via telnet to Router (5406zl)
 ProCurve# config
 ProCurve(config)# ip routing
 ProCurve(config)# ip multicast-routing
 ProCurve(config)# router pim
 ProCurve(config)# vlan 1      //the 19 subnet
 ProCurve(vlan-1)# ip igmp
 ProCurve(vlan-1)# ip pim-dense ip-addr 192.168.19.21   //This is the switches IP in VLAN 1, you may only need this if the switch is multihomed in that subnet
 ProCurve(vlan-1-pim-dense)# vlan 4
 ProCurve(vlan-4)# ip igmp
 ProCurve(vlan-4)# ip pim-dense 
 ProCurve(vlan-4-pim-dense)# vlan 5
 ProCurve(vlan-5)# ip igmp
 ProCurve(vlan-5)# ip pim-dense
 ProCurve(vlan-5-pim-dense)# write mem
 ProCurve(vlan-5-pim-dense)# exit
 ProCurve(vlan-5)# exit

switch may need to be rebooted if router PIM was not already enabled
consult manual for exact details on your switch
===Procurve Switch Commands - Layer 2===

Commands for the layer 2 switches to enable IGMP routing
While applying these settings to sub-switches is not required, not enabling IMGP on the switch
may create excessive traffic to ALL nodes of the switch during a multicast session.

By enabling IGMP allows the switch to send multicast packets to only the computers who have joined the session.
