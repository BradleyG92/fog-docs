== Contributing to the FOG Project ==

If you use and/or like FOG and would like to help the project evolve there are many ways to do so.  Please see the following list for ways in which you can aid in the development of FOG.

<ul>
<li><b>Report Bugs</b> - Bug reports are very important to us!  If you encounter an error that isn't in the Bug Tracker please report it, this helps us make a better and more stable product.</li>
<li><b>Add to or Create a wiki page</b> - We are not very good at documentation, so if you see a spelling mistake or a grammar issue and want to fix it please do.  Also if you feel that the documentation is missing something and would like to add it we would love it if you did!</li>
<li><b>Make a feature request</b> - If you think there is something missing from FOG that you would like to see added, you probably are not the only one that could use it, make a feature request and we will try to add it to FOG.</li>
<li><b>Code</b> - If you know a little programming and think something is sloppy or could be done better, pass it along.  Or if you want to or have added a new feature to FOG that isn't part of the core package let us know and we will attempt to include it.</li>
<li><b>Spread the Word</b> - Submit an objective article about FOG to a web based publication, or just mention FOG to a colleague.</li>
<li><b>Dark Coin</b> - Under Advanced Tasks there is a Donate option. Set it up and run it. This will donate directly to Fog's account.  '''(getting address)'''</li>
