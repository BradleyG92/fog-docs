# Windows OEM licenses {#windows_oem_licenses}

Microsoft has changed their reimaging license in February 2011 so that
you can\'t distribute an OEM image if you doesn\'t buy a full packaged
product (FPP) or have a Volume Licensing program. This means that you
have to buy an extra Win7 license besides the Win7 OEM license included
in most computers.

Text from the Microsoft license document: *\"Organizations do not have
the right to reimage by using OEM media. An OEM image can only be
preloaded on a PC by the OEM during manufacturing.\"*
