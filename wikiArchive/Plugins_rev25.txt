Plugins add more functionality to FOG. 
===== Enabling Plugins =====
Plugins are not enabled on the FOG server by default, so this is the first thing we will need to do.

#Log in to the FOG Web UI.
#Go to the '''About''' Icon
#Scroll Down and locate the section '''Plugin System''' and change '''FOG_PLUGINSYS_ENABLED''' from '''0''' to '''1''' and select Save Changes.

== Capone ==
Capone is a plugin for FOG that allows you to image a computer based on DMI/Hardware information without having to register it with the FOG server.  This module was originally written for a HP computer warranty service center in the UK.  They wanted to be able to restore a computer's image just by plugging it into the network and PXE booting the machine, without any user intervention.  This module is great for repair shops and places where you don't need FOG to manage the computer after it is imaged.  This is our attempt at pushing FOG into the service/repair sector.
