== Setup & Installation ==

# Insert your Ubuntu installation disc and reboot the computer. Boot from the disc, Ubuntu will launch in it’s live form for you to get a feel for the OS or install. You will be presented with two options, install Ubuntu or run a Live instance. Click the “Install Ubuntu” Option when it is presented to you at the Welcome screen.
# Proceed with a normal install of Ubuntu.  It is recommended to make the choice to Download the Latest updates while installing by Ticking the checkbox. Ubuntu will now examine hardware and alert you of any previously existing operating systems.  Recommended that you remove all information unless you have other OS's you want to keep on the system. During the install Ubuntu will ask you to set your timezone, Layout, and some user information such as a user name and password.  Set this information to your liking. In the latest flavors of Ubuntu the Root user account is disabled, after installation this guide will show you how to enable it. Ubuntu will copy files and begin the installation.
# After installation is complete, reboot. Remove the installation disc and press enter, your computer will reboot and boot up in it’s new operating system that is much faster and more durable than it’s squishy, virus prone, partners. Log in with the Password and the User you specified during installation.

Your system should now be installed and ready to go.

== Enabling Root on Ubuntu ==

# Please open up a terminal or console and log in as the user you created.
# To gain access, enter the following command and re-type the user password.
#*<pre>sudo su -</pre>
#Then type the following command:
#*<pre>passwd root</pre>
#*It will ask you to enter the new password.  You will not see anything being entered, but it is typing.  Once complete Press Enter.
#*It will ask you to confirm the password.  You will not see anything being entered, but it is typing.  Once complete Press Enter.
#*The terminal will return with <code>Password updated successfully!</code>
#Type or copy the following code into the terminal and press enter.
#*<pre>echo "greeter-show-manual-login=true" >> /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf</pre>
#Please restart the machine with the command:
#*<pre>shutdown -r now</pre>
#Once the system returns, you can now login as the root user even from the GUI.  Just type the username: <code>root</code>  in the Password field, you'll type the password you set in the passwd root command above.

== Setting static IP ==
# Click the “Dash Home” icon again, in the text box at the top type “Network” and select the first icon in the list displayed as “Network”. Select Wired and click Options. Select the “IPV4 Settings” tab and change the method from Automatic to Manual, Add, and supply the server with a proper IP address and information. Click Save. Your connection will reconnect.
# Next click on FireFox and in the browser navigate to the webpage http://www.fogproject.org and follow the download links to download the latest version of FOG, at the time of writing it is 0.32. Right mouse click and select show in folder and close your browser and all other open windows. Move the file to your desktop if you haven’t already. Right mouse click and select “Extract Here”.
# Now open a terminal and issue the following commands
#<pre>sudo nano /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head</pre>
# Add the following line where x.x.x.x is the ip address of your DNS.  If you need to supply multiple DNS entries, separate entries with a space (i.e. nameserver x.x.x.x y.y.y.y z.z.z.z)
#<pre>nameserver x.x.x.x</pre>

''' NOTE: GIVEN THE DATE OF THE FOG 0.32 REVISION SOME PACKAGES ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTED AND MUST BE UPDATED WE WILL DO THIS FIRST!!! '''

== Update and Install Packages ==
*Click on the “Dash Home” Icon again, type “Terminal” into the search box and select the first Icon. Now we are going to install FOG and configure it. We will do the installation through the Terminal with a number of commands, please follow them and remember to press enter after each line. Note the Capital and lower case letters, linux is VERY picky, “A” is not the same as “a”.

#* Type the Password again and press enter.
#* Type the Password again and press enter.
#* Type Y to send your install information to the Project, and it will take some time to complete.

== New Web Layout ==
'''Ubuntu 14.04 moved from the /var/www document root to /var/www/html document root layout.  Because of this, we have to either move the /var/www/fog directory to /var/www/html or simply create a link.'''
=== Open a terminal and sudo up to root. ===
* <pre>sudo su -</pre>
'''Move fog folder so it's accessible.'''
* <pre>mv /var/www/fog /var/www/html/</pre>
'''Link the folder instead of move.'''
* <pre>ln -s /var/www/fog /var/www/html/fog</pre>

== Complete the configuration ==
# Now we need to set up the web GUI for FOG. Open your browser and navigate to http://(serveripaddress)/fog/management. Or click the link in the Terminal window.
# The web GUI will alert you to back up your database for MYSQL Server and install the upgrades, do so and follow the upgrade instructions.
# Next log in, default user name is FOG and the password is password.
# Click “User Management” the Second Icon from the Left. Click “New User” on the left and set up a new user. Supply the name, password, and check the “Mobile/Quick Access only” box and press create user. In the PXE menu when doing a Quick Image, you will need to provide the username and password specified here to complete the image process.
# Image Management will allow you to create images, '''NOTE: MUST BE DONE PRIOR TO IMPORTING A HOST TO YOUR FOG SERVER''', otherwise you will have to create one and select it later. Click “New Image” on the left. Give the image a name, a description, select “Default” for Storage, and give the file a name, no spaces. Select Multiple Partition image – Single Disk (Not resizeable) or Multiple Partition image – All Disks (Not resizeable) I have never had a problem using these settings. However Single Partition (NTFS, Only Re-sizable) will work as well. DO NOT use the RAW format, it takes a long time to upload and does so sector by sector. This would be a recommendation if you are backing up a Linux partition. Click Add.
# Host Management will allow you to manually add or manage a host, I recommend using the PXE menu to register your hosts, but if you need to change information or the image type you can do it here.
# Your FOG server is configured and setup, register a host via the PXE menu.
# On your FOG Server in the WEB GUI, click on Task Management. On the left hand side, select “List all hosts” click on the “Upload” arrow for the host you just added. Select when you want the task to run, I set it a few minutes in the future. FOG has the ability to reboot your machine into the PXE menu to begin it’s process, but I simply reboot the computer, fog will find it and begin the image process
# CONGRATULATIONS you now have a working FOG Server and a host image ready to deploy. In order to deploy an Image, boot into the PXE menu and register the host, next select “Quick Image” and begin the image process, or select the host from the “Task Management” screen and select “Deploy” and reboot the workstation after supplying a time to begin the task, the workstation will begin its image process.
