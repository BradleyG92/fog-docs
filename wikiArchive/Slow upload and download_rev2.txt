If your upload and download seem to be particularly slow, and things were faster on a previous version of FOG, you may want to lower the compression effort: less effort means less compression, but may end up being faster.

Do this by changing the FOG_PIGZ_COMP setting (9 in FOG 1.0.0 and later, but 3 in earlier versions). You find this under FOG Settings, FOG Boot Settings..
