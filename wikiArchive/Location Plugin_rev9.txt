== Location Plugin ==


The location plugin is for use in multi-node fog setups that have a large distance or limited amount of bandwidth between each node's network. The location plugin allows you to restrict a host's storage node selection when imaging or other tasks occur.

For instance, say you have three physical sites. Site A, B, and C. Let's also say that all of these sites are interconnected by a 6Mbps link. If all storage nodes are not busy when a host at location C is told to image, it's possible that this host may select the storage nodes at locations A or B to pull it's image from. And on a 6Mbps link, this is not good. What the location plugin enables you to do is to assign a location to each of these sites, and then assign each site's storage nodes to the correct location, and then to assign each sites hosts to the correct location. Then when a host is told to image, it will be restricted to the correct location.
