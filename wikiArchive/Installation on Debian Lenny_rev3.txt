== 4-24-2012: These instructions have been updated to work with Debian Squeeze 6.0.4 ==

Basically use the Ubuntu instructions except for:
#Do not install the additional languages as the required packages aren't available in Lenny, at least by default.
#If you want clamav to work you need to do the following:  [[Clamav]].


== Download and Running of Installation Script ==
*You will find the latest "Stable" release of FOG here'''[http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/files/latest/download?source=files sourceforge]'''
*You can also update to the latest "Beta". Please see [[Upgrade_to_trunk]]
FOR EXAMPLE: 
<pre>
  cd /opt/
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/freeghost/FOG/fog_0.32/fog_0.32.tar.gz
  tar -xvzf fog_0.32.tar.gz
  cd fog_0.32/bin/
  ./installfog.sh 
  nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
</pre>

You will be prompted for the Linux distro you are installing, enter '''2''' and press '''enter'''.

You will be prompted for the installation mode, either N (Normal Server) or S(Storage Server).  If you are not sure which option to select, use N for Normal Installation. (Version 0.24 and up) 

The installer will ask you for the IP address of the server, then press '''enter'''.

The installer will ask if you would like to enter a router address for DHCP, if you would like to press '''y''' and press '''enter''', then enter the address, then press '''enter'''.

The installer will ask if you would like to enter a DNS address for DHCP and the boot image, if you would like to press '''y''' and press '''enter''', then enter the address, then press '''enter'''.

You would then be prompted if you would like to change the default interface from eth0, if you would like press '''y''', press '''enter''' and add the interface (if you are unsure, select '''n''').  

 Would you like to use the FOG server for dhcp service? [Y/n]
 
 DHCP will not be setup but you must setup your
 
 current DHCP server to use FOG for pxe services.
 
 On a Linux DHCP server you must set:
 
 next-server
 
 On a Windows DHCP server you must set:
 
 option 066 & 067
 
 FOG now has everything it needs to setup your server, but please
 understand that this script will overwrite any setting you may
 have setup for services like DHCP, apache, pxe, tftp, and NFS.
 
 It is not recommended that you install this on a production system
 as this script modifies many of your system settings.
 
 This script should be run by the root user on Fedora, or with sudo on Ubuntu.
 
 Here are the settings FOG will use:
         Distro: Ubuntu
         Server IP Address: 192.168.0.150
         DHCP router Address: 192.168.0.1
         DHCP DNS Address: 192.168.0.150
         Interface: eth0
         Using FOG DHCP: 0


Are you sure you wish to continue (Y/N) Y

During the installation you may be prompted to set a MySQL root password, leave this blank unless you wish to edit the FOG config.php files before the next step (by using sudo vi in the terminal, see file locations below).

/opt/fog/service/etc/config.php
'''and''' 
/var/www/fog/commons/config.php

Both of these have to be edited with the MySQL password if you set one, for Fog to function properly.  Also, add '''root''' under MYSQL_USERNAME if it is missing.

Look for the message: '''Setup complete!'''  If this message is not displayed, the script has failed before all configurations were written.  Fix any problems and re-run the script until it completes successfully.

After the installation has completed open Firefox again and enter the URL: http://[youripaddress]/fog/management. You will then be prompted to install the database schema.  Click on the '''Install/Update Now''' button.

I had to run **chown -R fog:root /images**

'''Update:''' In recent versions of Debian Squeeze (tested on 6.0.4) you must change the TFTP_DIRECTORY path located in /etc/default/tftpd-hpa from "/srv/tftp" to "/tftpboot", or you can just symlink /tftpboot to /srv/tftp. ''If you don't your client computers will fail to PXE boot because they will not be able to find pxelinux.0!''

== Debian Squeeze 6.0 Modifications TO-DO ==
''pardon my english cuz i'm froggy-frenchy | Kenny432'' 

If you want a fresh installation of FOG-Project 0.30 on your fresh Debian Squeeze 6.0 you'd better do this

* Do not install the "additional languages pack" because it's not in Squeeze, so to that question, '''answer N'''
* The DHCP Server on Debian Squeeze is no more '''dhcp3-server''' but '''isc-dhcp-server'''. It changes the following things :
** the config file for isc-dhcp-server is now /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
** the install script has to be modified like so :

For : '''/opt/fog/lib/ubuntu/functions.sh''' 
*l.353 & l.354 replace with the following
**  /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server stop >/dev/null 2>&1;
**  /etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server start >/dev/null 2>&1;

For : '''/opt/fog/lib/ubuntu/config.sh''' 
**  l.24 : replace '''dhcp3-server''' by '''isc-dhcp-server'''
**  l.27 : replace the line with : dhcpname="isc-dhcp-server";
**  l.46 : replace the line with : dhcpconfig="/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf";

==== DHCPD Config File ====

This is a short example for a simple dhcpd.conf created by FOG

  # DHCP Server Configuration file.
  # see /usr/share/doc/dhcp*/dhcpd.conf.sample
  # This file was created by FOG
  use-host-decl-names on;
  ddns-update-style interim;
  ignore client-updates;
  next-server 192.168.1.42;
  
  subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
          option subnet-mask              255.255.255.0;
          range dynamic-bootp 192.168.1.70 192.168.1.79;
          default-lease-time 21600;
          max-lease-time 43200;
          option domain-name-servers      192.168.1.100;
          option routers      192.168.1.1;
          filename "pxelinux.0";
  }

Now it should install fine. I'll complete it if I have other troubles with the installation. Enjoy !

==== Tweak for Wheezy ====
Wheezy ships with a new version of php.  The tweaks may or may not help.

http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/286962-can-t-get-fog-to-create-a-task

nano /var/www/fog/management/includes/tasks.confirm.include.php

Search for: &$tmp

Replace with: $tmp

Replace All

Also see http://fogproject.org/forum/threads/php-5-4-fog-0-32.3921/

nano /var/www/fog/management/lib/Group.class.php

<nowiki>if ( $host->startTask($conn, $tasktype, $blShutdown, $port, $mcId, null, null, null, &$ireason) )</nowiki>

should be replaced by

<nowiki>if ( $host->startTask($conn, $tasktype, $blShutdown, $port, $mcId, null, null, null, $ireason) )</nowiki>
