in this example i will use the partedmagic ISO, but Clonezilla, Linux ditros, Hirens, and other bootable ISO's can be used

create a folder in  /tftpboot/fog/  called partedmagic,  copy the partedmagic.iso file into this folder and also copy and paste the memdisk file found in /tftpboot/fog/ 

browse to /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/ and edit the 'default' file in there and add 



<pre>
LABEL PartedMagic
        kernel fog/partedmagic/memdisk 
        append iso initrd=fog/partedmagic/partedmagic.iso raw
        MENU PartedMagic
        TEXT HELP
        Gparted + Clonezilla + Firefox
        ENDTEXT</pre>

Please remember that if you create a new folder on the tftp folder you will also need to include memdisk in the same folder!  The link above also inlcudes a TFTP folder you can use to try on your own.  It includes dban and dell diagnostics's .iso's.
