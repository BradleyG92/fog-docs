</ul>


==Fog Server==
Here is the tricky part.....You need to copy the hidden files on your Linux server to your windows server. These files are located @:

/images/.mntcheck --> c:\images\
/images/dev/.mntcheck --> c:\images\dev\

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ==> ip address of the windows server

I mounted the NFS drive and just did a cp command.

<pre>
cd /
sudo mkdir images2
sudo chmod 777 images2
sudo mount xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/images /images2
sudo cp /images/.mntcheck /images2
sudo cp /images/dev/.mntcheck /images2/dev/
sudo umount /images2
</pre>
