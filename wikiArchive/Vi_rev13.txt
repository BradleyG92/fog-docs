== Quick reference for basic editing in vi ==




go into insert mode, here you may use arrows to navigate text, and edit it with the keyboard as normal:
<pre>i</pre> 

Esc (the escape key) = exit insert mode


WHEN NOT in insert mode you may use:

write changes:
<pre>:w   (then enter)</pre> 

exit vi:
<pre>:q   (then enter)</pre>

exit vi without saving changes:
<pre>:q!   (then enter)</pre>


Example of usage...

<pre>[root@localhost ~]# vi /README.txt</pre>

<pre>i
This is my first readme file, wrote with vi!
(Esc key)
:w
:q</pre>

<pre>[root@localhost ~]# cat /README.txt
this is my first readme file, wrote with vi!</pre>
