== Overview ==
An existing network is assumed to have DHCP and DNS services already functioning on separate server(s), as well as full Internet connectivity. No changes will be required on existing infrastructure. Also network operation will not be affected. The only inconvenience is that in order to image computer one had to know it's MAC address.

'''Note:''' The FOG installation makes several queries to resources on the Internet. The server must be connected to the Internet during the initial installation.

== Installation ==
<ol>
<li>Install the base OS</li>
<li>Connect to the Internet and update the base OS</li>
<li>[[FOGUserGuide#Installing_FOG|Install FOG]]
<ol>
<li><tt>What type of installation would you like to do? [N] n</tt><br>
Choose Normal. Read the on-screen explanation for details.</li>
<li><tt>  What is the IP address to be used by this FOG Server? [current address]'''192.168.1.1'''</tt><br>
Your server's current Internet address is displayed. It is better to use static IP address</li>
<li><tt>  Would you like to setup a router address for the DHCP server? [Y/n] n</tt><br>
No.</li>
<li><tt>  Would you like to setup a DNS address for the DHCP server and client boot image? [Y/n] n</tt><br>
No.</li>
<li><tt>  Would you like to change the default network interface from eth0?<br>
:  If you are not sure, select No. [y/N] n</tt><br>
This would allow us to keep one network card connected to the Internet, and use a second network card for the internal private network. This is beyond the scope of this guide.</li>
<li><tt>  Would you like to use the FOG server for dhcp service? [Y/n] Y</tt><br>
Yes. This allows clients to get IP addresses on the network and connect to the FOG server.</li>
<li><tt>  This version of FOG has internationalization support, would you like to install the additional language packs? [Y/n]</tt><br>
Choose Yes if you'd like to install additional languages</li>

  FOG now has everything it needs to setup your server, but please
  understand that this script will overwrite any setting you may
  have setup for services like DHCP, apache, pxe, tftp, and NFS.
  
  It is not recommended that you install this on a production system
  as this script modifies many of your system settings.

  This script should be run by the root user on Fedora, or with sudo on Ubuntu.

  Here are the settings FOG will use:
         Distro: Ubuntu
         Installation Type: Normal Server
         Server IP Address: X.X.X.X (your IP address)
         DHCP router Address: 
         DHCP DNS Address: 
         Interface: eth0
         Using FOG DHCP: 1
         Internationalization: 1

  Are you sure you wish to continue (Y/N) y</pre>
If it all looks good, enter Y</li>

The following message is displayed:<pre>  * Installing package: mysql-server

     We are about to install MySQL Server on 
     this server, if MySQL isn't installed already
     you will be prompted for a root password.  If
     you don't leave it blank you will need to change
     it in the config.php file located at:
     
     /var/www/fog/commons/config.php

Just press enter a couple times.</li>

In one person's experience, this step freezes more often than not. If you choose Yes and it takes longer than a few seconds, it is likely frozen. 
Here is a solution: [[Thank_you,_sending_notification]]</li>
<pre>Done



  Setup complete!

  You still need to install/update your database schema.
  This can be done by opening a web browser and going to:

      http://192.168.1.5/fog/management

      Default User:
             Username: fog
             Password: password

$</pre>
</ol>
<li>Immediately stop Fog's DHCP server not to affect the network</li>
<li>Edit Fog's dhcpd.conf the following way:

<pre>
# DHCP Server Configuration file.
# see /usr/share/doc/dhcp*/dhcpd.conf.sample
# This file was created by FOG
use-host-decl-names on;
ddns-update-style interim;
ignore client-updates;
# Fog's IP address:
next-server 172.16.23.195; 

# Subnet where you are going to use Fog
subnet 172.16.23.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        option subnet-mask              255.255.255.0;
        default-lease-time 21600;
        max-lease-time 43200;
}

# This machine will receive DHCP offer from Fog's DHCP
host optiplex990_1 {
        hardware ethernet 78:2B:CB:CC:CC:CC;
        fixed-address 172.16.23.251;
        option host-name "test1";
        filename "pxelinux.0";
        #Default router (if needed)
        option routers      172.16.23.1;
}
</pre>
<li>Start Fog's dhcpd server</li>
<li>Ensure that only machine which MAC address were entered to dhcpd.conf can receive DHCP offer from Fog server</li>
<li>If you want to add another machine edit dhcpd.conf and add the new host section:<br>
<pre>
host NewHost {
        hardware ethernet 78:2B:CB:CC:CC:1F;
        fixed-address 172.16.23.252;
        option host-name "test2";
        filename "pxelinux.0";
        #Default router (if needed)
        option routers      172.16.23.1;
}
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
