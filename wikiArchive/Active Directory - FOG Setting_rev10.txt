==Overview==
FOG can automatically join computers to an Active Directory domain.

==Requirements==
*FOG client application installed on hosts (usually as part of the image)
*FOG server configured to join computer computers to the domain
*FOG HostNameChanger module active on server, client, and in host configuration
*FOG 0.31 and earlier may require netdom.exe on hosts

==Where to Configure==

===Turn on HostNameChanger module===
This module determines if a host will join the domain. It must be enabled in several locations for it to work properly.

*When installing or reconfiguring the FOG client application on the host, this module must be made active for the computer to auto-join the domain.
*On the host record in the fog WebUI, Active Directory menu option must be checked to enable "Join domain after image task".
*In the server webUI, FOG configuration menu option, HostNameChanger menu option on the left, service must be enabled.

===FOG Defaults===
Set the default domain, username, password, and organization unit (OU) for joining computer accounts to the domain. See [[#Syntax]] details about the values for each field.

*Web UI: Other Information -> FOG Settings


===Groups===
Set the domain, username, password, and organization unit (OU) for joining hosts to the domain for all hosts currently in this group. See [[#Syntax]] details about the values for each field.

*Web UI: Group Management
*Search for Group name or click "List Groups"
*Click on the name of the group in the list
*Active Directory option in the menu on the left

'''Note:''' This is a applied in a batch for each host in the group when saved. These settings are not stored in the group settings permanently, nor applied to future hosts automatically when added to the group.

===Individual Hosts===
Set the domain, username, password, and organization unit (OU) for joining the host to the domain. See [[#Syntax]] details about the values for each field.

*Web UI: Host Management
*Search for host name or click "List All Hosts"
*Select the host computer
*Active Directory option in the menu on the left


==Syntax==

===Domain Name===
The fully qualified domain name.

Examples:

*company
*company.ad
*company.com
*company.local

===Organizational Unit===
The organizational unit, in LDAP format.

Exmaples:

*OU=PCs,DC=company,DC=com
*OU=Lab Computers,OU=PCs,DC=company,DC=com
*[Blank] Leaving this blank will join the default OU for new PCs, usually "Computers"

===Domain Username===
The user in your domain you wish to use to add the computers to Active Directory.

[domain]\[account]

In Fog versions 1.0+ you do not need to specify the domain in the username field, it adds it automatically.
you only need to have [account]

Example:

*company\FOGServiceAccount

For Fog 1.0+
'''Caveat is that do NOT Add the domain or it will not work.'''

*FOGServiceAccount


'''Note: Domain does not need to be fully qualified for Domain Username'''

===Domain Password===

For FOG 1.3.0+ The password should be typed plain-text, and will auto-encrypt on it's own when saved.

For the Legacy client (not recommended), the domain password must be encrypted using [[FOGCrypt]].

==Testing with Netdom to troubleshoot==

Windows Command Line(cmd)

'''FOGPassword is NOT encrypted for the command line test.'''

===Join Domain===

netdom JOIN mypcHostname /Domain:SyperiorSoft  /OU:FOGou  /UserD:FOGUser /passwordd:FOGPassword /reboot:35

===Remove from Domain===

netdom REMOVE mypcHostname /domain:SyperiorSoft /UserD:FOGUser /passwordd:FOGPassword
