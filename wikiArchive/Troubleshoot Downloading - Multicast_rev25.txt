= Multicast's roles in FOG =

Multicasting in FOG uses UDPcast to send a single image to multiple computers using only slightly more bandwidth than sending the image to a single computer or unicast. Multicasting will be slightly slower than a single unicast task because unicast decompresses the image on the target hosts, while multicast decompresses the image at server level and then sends the decompressed image to the hosts.

Inside the FOG DB, there are two multicast association tables. You can delete all the rows in those tables, re-install FOG, and try again.


<pre>mysql
use fog
DELETE FROM `multicastSessions` WHERE 1;
DELETE FROM `multicastSessionsAssoc` WHERE 1;
DELETE FROM `tasks` WHERE `taskTypeID` = 8;
quit</pre>

Check the status of FOGMulticastManager and restart:

Fedora:
<pre>systemctl status FOGMulticastManager
systemctl restart FOGMulticastManager</pre>

Ubuntu:
<pre>sudo service FOGMulticastManager status
sudo service FOGMulticastManager restart</pre>
