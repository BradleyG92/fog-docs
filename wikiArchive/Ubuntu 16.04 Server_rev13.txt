= Extra steps for Ubuntu 16 =

Two bumps in the road, of which the forums and wiki covered. I’ll try to unify some instructions in the Ubuntu Server article.

Basics are exactly what has already been posted in the forums and wiki.
* When you are ready, run the installer with 
<pre>php_ver='7.0' php_verAdds='-7.0' ./installfog.sh</pre>
* When the installer asks you to update the database, there’s 1 extra step. (in another SSH session) Go to mysql and modify the password setting with:
<pre>ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';</pre>
Then you go to the web interface and update the DB as normal, come back to the installer and complete it as usual.
