== Requirements ==
Before diving right into the installation of FOG you need to decide which server OS you are going to use. FOG is made to install on RedHat based distro CentOS, Fedora, RHEL amongst others as well as Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux. Choose whichever you like most and have knowledge about! FOG is known to work with any of the above noted systems. [[Installation manuals]] are available for most current releases.

This listing is for informational purposes only, as the required components will be automatically downloaded and installed by the FOG installation script: PHP 5/6/7, MySql 5+, Apache 2+, DHCP (any!), TFTP, FTP, NFS

The LAMP setup can also be easily adjusted for a "WAMP (Windows Apache MySQL PHP) system" though will require a bit more knowledge of what packages to use and how to integrate with the FOG system.
