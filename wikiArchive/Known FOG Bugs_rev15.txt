== The Image Resize Bug ==

=== Description ===

This bug became present sometime around r2920 to 3277. It is unrelated to boot-files and kernels.

When an image is uploaded as "resizable", the resize does not occur during the upload. Any images created between 2920 - 3277 could be affected.

When downloading an image to hosts that have the same size HDD as the source machine, or a larger size HDD as the source machine, imaging completes as normal.

When downloading an image to hosts that have a '''smaller size HDD than the source machine''', errors are encountered and imaging does not complete.

Some hosts will never get to the partclone process, some hosts do but fail during the imaging process.


=== Verifying your image is affected ===

Start a download task with debugging.

Run this command:

<pre>fdisk -l</pre>

Examine the output.

Look closely at the three highlighted areas. The first is the command issued, the second is the size of the installed HDD, the third is the size of the image's partitions.

'''If the partition data is larger than the size of the installed HDD, your image is affected.'''


=== Fixing your image ===


To fix the image, first update to FOG revision 3451 or later, and install an HDD of equal or greater size than the source machine had.

Deploy your image to this host with the larger HDD.

Boot the host and verify all is well.

Shutdown the host.

Create a new image, be sure to mark it as "resizeable" along with any other necessary settings, and assign this new image to the host using the FOG Web UI.

Create a new upload task, and upload the new image.

The new image should now be able to deploy to hosts with smaller HDDs than the source machine.

You may now delete the old image.
