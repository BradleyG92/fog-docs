FOG relies on many passwords. On a simple installation most of these are handled automatically. On more advanced installations troubleshooting password mismatches can be challenging. The page linked below aims to be a single resource to explain all passwords necessary for FOG in all its various configurations.
=== Common Knowledge ===

The only password that is encrypted in FOG is the password used for joining computers to a domain; Info->FOG Settings->Active Directory Defaults; all other passwords are listed in plain text.

=== Basic Installation ===
====<!-- A simple explanation of the password -->Fog's user account on main FOG server====
	<!-- Additional explanation, if necessary -->This is a standard user account on the server. It is named 'fog'<br>
Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
	<ul>
		<li><!-- first likely error -->FOG can't do anything</li>
		<li><!-- second likely error -->Unexpected, strange errors</li>
		<li><!-- third likely error, etc -->...</li>
	</ul>
How to modify this password:
:The location varies per operating system.
:To reset it, type this at the command line on the Main FOG server:
<pre>sudo passwd fog</pre>

====FOG user on web interface====
Common errors associated with a mismatched password:
<ul><li>Can't log into FOG web interface</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>How to update it:<br>
:<tt>sudo ...</tt>
====MySQL root user ====
The MySQL root user is normally only used on the main Fog server.  Storage nodes use the <tt>fogstorage</tt> user instead of root.

Common errors associated with a mismatched password:
<ul><li><pre>Unable to connect to Database 
Msg: Failed to connect to server: localhost Server returned: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES) </pre></li><li>[https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/forums/forum/716419/topic/4859086/index/page/1 Scheduled Tasks fail to run]</li></ul>
How to update it:<br>
:Changing the root admin password in MySQL is not simple. It's a lot easier to enter a known root password in the file mentioned below. This is an older guide, but might be helpful if a root password is lost:
http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/442
<ul>Additional notes<li>In a private network this is usually not set. The installer urges a blank password.</li>
<li>The password is also in the following files:<ul><li><tt>/var/www/fog/commons/config.php</tt></li>
<li><tt>/opt/fog/service/etc/config.php</tt></li></ul></li>
</ul>

====FOG Quick Image password====
How to update it:<br>
From the GUI: 
:About > PXE Boot Menu > 
From command line (note this will be overwritten if the GUI is updated)
:<tt>sudo vi tftpboot\pxelinux.cfg\default</tt>


== Additional Passwords Outside of a Basic Installation ==

=== Storage Nodes ===
====FOG user account on storage node====
	<ul>Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
		<li><unknown></li>
	</ul>
How to update it:
:On the Storage Node: <tt>sudo passwd fog</tt>
====MySQL connector back to Main FOG server====
	<ul>Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
		<li><tt>/images/</tt> directory does not update - contains no images</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
How to update it:
<pre>vi /var/www/fog/commons/config.php
define( "MYSQL_DATABASE", "fog" ); 
define( "MYSQL_USERNAME", "fogstorage" ); 
define( "MYSQL_PASSWORD", "b83cd3" );</pre>
====FTP Connection from Storage Node to Master FOG Server====
	<ul>Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
		<li><unknown at this time></li>
	</ul>
How to test it:
<OL><LI>On the Master FOG Server, copy the password from this file:

...
...
define( "STORAGE_FTP_USERNAME", "fog" );
define( "STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD", "[---------longPassword---------]" );
...</pre></LI>
<li>Using the above credentials, attempt an FTP session back to the Main FOG Server<br>
From the Storage Node:<pre>ftp [FOG_Main_Server_IPAddr]
Connected to [IPAddr].

Name ([IPAddr]:[user]):fog
331 Please specify the password.
Password: [paste that longPassword from above]
230 Login successful.</pre>
</LI></ol>
