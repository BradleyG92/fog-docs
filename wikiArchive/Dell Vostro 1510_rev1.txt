I have experimenting for the 1st time today with FOG and i've heard lots of great stories about it working. However, I have 35 Dell VOSTRO 1510 laptops that I would like to have built with it! It appears to initially not recognise the hard disk, so I changed the disk from ACPI to ATA in the BIOS in the hope that it would see it. After doing this, it did not complain about not seeing the disk, but came up with the error:[[Image:Photo-1-.jpg]]

Actually, I just tried putting "irqpoll" into the Host Kernel Arguments field for the host and it works!
