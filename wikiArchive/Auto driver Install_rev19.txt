In Progress:  Documentation for adding the Auto Driver install script from Frontier School Division.

Overview:  The Auto Driver install script is an addon for FOG that allows you to build a hardware independent Windows 7 image.  Devices on the system will be detected by FOG, and drivers inserted 

==Setup Repository==
*Create a folder inside of /images named drivers
 mkdir /images/drivers
*Create a Common folder for drivers/scripts you want on all systems.
 mkdir /images/drivers/Common
*Create a SetupComplete.cmd file.  This is a script, that when copied to C:\Windows\Setup\Scripts is executed at the end of the SysPrep process.  The Frontier script stops the FOG service, runs a netsh command to push out a wlan profile, deletes the profile xml file, the sysprep.xml and fixes the permissions on the C:\drivers folder.  It's a quite useful tool to use.  I recommend at least having:
 net STOP "Fog Service"
 start "Reset C:\Drivers Permissions" /wait "icacls" C:\drivers /reset /t >>"C:\FOGDriverInstall.log 2>&1

===Adding Drivers===
*The script currently detects three categories of Drivers: PCI, USB & PNP.
*The first step is to identify the device that you want to install.  On an imaged Windows 7 machine, go to device Manager.
**Right click the device, and go to Properties.
**Click the details tab, and go to the Hardware IDs dropdown.


==Install Script==

==Building the Universal Image==
*Include driver search path to C:\Drivers (Detect it in the script maybe and add the reg entry if it's missing?)
