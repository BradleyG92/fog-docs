This article has been updated to reflect settings in the 1.3.0 release.

= Web Interface =

Default username is <font color="red">fog</font>
Default password is <font color="red">password</font>

If you loose this password, and you have root access to the main fog server, you can reset it to the default via CLI.

<pre>
mysql
use fog
UPDATE `users` SET `uPass` = '$2y$11$g0Hu8OaOStuPk7WWYGh6Wu4PLlZDZGOkzMwEEAk.rZMrI9IdDwno.' WHERE `uName` = 'fog';
</pre>

Alternatively, if the <font color="red">fog</font> user does not exist, you may create it with the default password via CLI.

<pre>
mysql
use fog
INSERT INTO `users` (`uName`,`uPass`,`uCreateBy`,`uType`) VALUES ('fog','$2y$11$g0Hu8OaOStuPk7WWYGh6Wu4PLlZDZGOkzMwEEAk.rZMrI9IdDwno.','localAdmin','0');
</pre>

= Storage Management Credentials =

Accessed via the web interface, and then clicking on "Storage Management" in the ribbon. In here, you can view the storage nodes connected to your fog server. 

By clicking on one of the storage nodes, you enter into that storage node's settings area. In here is the FTP username and password used for managing this storage node. Please see [[Troubleshoot FTP]] for '''further troubleshooting'''.

= Active Directory =

There are three places where you can set Active Directory joining credentials. Two are persistent.

== Global Defaults ==

<font color="red">Web Interface -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> Active Directory Defaults -> FOG_AD_DEFAULT_USER</font>

<font color="red">Web Interface -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> Active Directory Defaults -> FOG_AD_DEFAULT_PASSWORD</font>

<font color="red">Web Interface -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> Active Directory Defaults -> FOG_AD_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_LEGACY</font>

These three areas are just place-holders. When ticking the checkbox to join a host to Active Directory (explained below), these global settings are what is used to populate the fields. These fields are also what is used when saying "Y" to joining Active Directory via network booting and doing a "Full Host Registration".

The FOG_AD_DEFAULT_PASSWORD field is used only for the new fog client. This field is typed in as plain-text, and upon saving, is encrypted using an industry-standard encryption technique. Please read through [[FOG_Client#Security_Design]] for more details on this.

The FOG_AD_DEFAULT_PASSWORD_LEGACY field is only used with the legacy fog client. This value must be encrypted first by "fogcrypt.exe". This program runs on windows via command prompt only, and is available for download at the bottom of every page in the fog web interface, including the login page. After running your password through this program, you would copy/paste the encrypted string it produces into the FOG_AD_DEFAULT_PASSWORD field. This field '''should not be set''' if you do not intend to use the legacy client. It's also '''strongly advised not use the legacy client''', and instead use the new fog client due to security concerns.

== Host Settings ==

You may individually set unique user/pass and domain information on a per-host basis if you wish. You can get to this area like this:

<font color="red">Web Interface -> Host Management -> [list all hosts or search] -> Click on the desired host -> Click "Active Directory"</font>

In this area, there are a few fields. When checking the "Join Domain after image task" checkbox, if global defaults are set, they are auto-populated into these fields. You may manually enter these fields with whatever domain/user/password you wish.

The two password fields "Domain Password" and "Domain Password Legacy" are explained above in the "Global Defaults" area.

== Group Settings ==

You may set Active Directory credentials on many hosts at once via groups. After setting AD Credentials here and then coming back to check this area in groups, you will see that the field is always blank. The settings are not applied to the group, but instead to each individual host. If you check the individual hosts (explained above), you will see that your settings have applied. Hosts later added to the group will not receive the previously applied settings, because the settings do not apply to the group, but instead to each individual host in the group and only at the time of applying the settings.

You can go to this area like this:

<font color="red">Web Interface -> Group Management -> [list all groups or search] -> Click the desired group -> Click "Active Directory"</font>

The two password fields "Domain Password" and "Domain Password Legacy" are explained above in the "Global Defaults" area.


= MySQL for Storage Nodes =

FOG 1.3.0 storage nodes communicate with the main server's database to get various work done. During installation, the installer will prompt you for a <font color="red">FOG_STORAGENODE_MYSQLUSER</font> and a <font color="red">FOG_STORAGENODE_MYSQLPASS</font>. 

The default username is <font color="red">fogstorage</font>

The password is always unique, and can be retrieved via the web interface here:

<font color="red">Web Interface -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> FOG Storage Nodes -> FOG_STORAGENODE_MYSQLPASS</font>

You would copy/paste this password value into the installer during installation.

If you need to change this password or username or server address later on a storage node, you may edit the <font color="red">/opt/fog/.fogsettings</font> on that particular node to update the password and then re-run the installer to complete changes. You may edit the file with Vi like this:

<font color="red">vi /opt/fog/.fogsettings</font>

Instructions on using Vi: [[vi]]

In this file, look for the fields <font color="red">snmysqluser=</font> and <font color="red">snmysqlpass=</font> and <font color="red">snmysqlhost=</font>. That's where you'd change the values, and then after saving and closing, re-run the installer to complete changes.

To change the password in MySQL, you would run one of the below commands on '''the main fog server'''.

Newer versions of MySQL and Ubuntu 16+:

<pre>mysql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';</pre>

Older versions of MySQL:

<pre>mysql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';</pre>

= MySQL for Main Server =

Typically, the user, password, and host is normally blank for the main server. The installer, unless told otherwise when it prompts, will assume a blank password.

To change the password in MySQL, it would be something like one of these:

Newer versions of MySQL and Ubuntu 16+:

<pre>mysql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '';</pre>

Older versions of MySQL:

<pre>mysql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '';</pre>

After having changed the password, it may be necessary to update the value inside of <font color="red">/opt/fog/.fogsettings</font> on the main server. You may edit the file with Vi like this:

<font color="red">vi /opt/fog/.fogsettings</font>

Instructions on using Vi: [[vi]]

In this file, look for the fields <font color="red">snmysqluser=</font> and <font color="red">snmysqlpass=</font> and <font color="red">snmysqlhost=</font>. That's where you'd change the values, and then after saving and closing, re-run the installer to complete changes.


= Proxy Settings =

If your organization uses a Proxy Server to access the web, you may set credentials and other settings for this '''if needed''' here:

<font color="red">Web Interface -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> Proxy Settings</font>

= Kernel Updates =

The username and password for FOG 1.3.0 kernel updates is oddly named, as you will see below. These credentials are the ones used when placing newly downloaded kernels and inits onto the server. See [[Kernel Update]] for more information on the process.

The username and password is located here:

<font color="red">Web Interface -> FOG Configuration -> FOG Settings -> TFTP Server</font>

= Local "fog" user =

Please do not use the local "fog" user account on the server to do back-end work. Create another account and use that. When building a new server, create a work account and do not create a "fog" user. This is absolutely not needed as the installer will create and maintain this user account.

The "fog" user is a local linux account on your fog server or fog storage node. It's also the account used by default for FTP access to any storage nodes (see Storage Management Credentials above).

To reset this password, you need to be this user, or root.

On any Linux system, you can elevate an administrative account to root like this:

<pre>sudo -i</pre>

And then provide your password.

You may change the fog password like this:

<pre>passwd fog</pre>

You'll be prompted for the new password, and then to re-enter it again.

Please see [[Troubleshoot FTP]] for a more complete article on this topic.

= .fogsettings =

Located here: <font color="red">/opt/fog/.fogsettings</font>

You may edit it with Vi like this:

<pre>vi /opt/fog/.fogsettings</pre>

Instructions on using Vi: [[vi]]

In this file, there are a whole lot of settings, passwords, addresses, etc. The important ones to note are these:

* <font color="red">password=</font>

* <font color="red">password=</font>

* <font color="red">password=</font>

* <font color="red">password=</font>

* <font color="red">password=</font>

* <font color="red">password=</font>






snmysqluser=
        snmysqlpass=
        snmysqlhost=

username='

fogguiuser=
fogguipass=


= config.class.php =

Typically located here: <font color="red">/var/www/html/fog/lib/fog/config.class.php</font>

You may view the file like this:

<pre>cat /var/www/html/fog/lib/fog/config.class.php</pre>

Used to be in '''older versions''' of FOG, this is where passwords and such would be set. It's no longer necessary to edit this file to set passwords, as the installer completely rebuilds this file every time it's ran. You simply need to make sure that the settings inside of <font color="red"/opt/fog/.fogsettings</font> are correct and then re-run the installer to update this file.

That said, you can view this file if you wish to see if passwords are being set correctly in it. Note that any changes manually made here but not reflected inside of .fogsettings will '''simply be overwritten''' upon the next fog update or re-run of the installer.








= Older instructions that DO NOT apply to 1.3.0 !! =

These are quite old instructions, they date back to pre-2012. This is before 1.2.0's time and most of this stuff is bad advice for 1.2.0.


== This page is a work in progress - feel free to help! ==
See the Discussions tab at the top for templates and known password locations.
And please, feel free to make adjustments and add content!<HR>
FOG relies on many passwords. On a simple installation most of these are handled automatically. On more advanced installations troubleshooting password mismatches can be challenging. The page linked below aims to be a single resource to explain all passwords necessary for FOG in all its various configurations.



=== Basic Installation ===
====<!-- A simple explanation of the password -->Fog's user account on main FOG server====
	<!-- Additional explanation, if necessary -->This is a standard user account on the server. It is named 'fog'<br>
Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
	<ul>
		<li><!-- first likely error -->FOG can't do anything</li>
		<li><!-- second likely error -->Unexpected, strange errors</li>
		<li><!-- third likely error, etc -->...</li>
	</ul>
How to modify this password:
:The location varies per operating system.
:To reset it, type this at the command line on the Main FOG server:
<pre>sudo passwd fog</pre>

====FOG user on web interface====
Common errors associated with a mismatched password:
<ul><li>Can't log into FOG web interface</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>How to update it:<br>
:<tt>sudo ...</tt>
====MySQL root user ====
The MySQL root user is normally only used on the main Fog server.  Storage nodes use the <tt>fogstorage</tt> user instead of root.

Common errors associated with a mismatched password:
<ul><li><pre>Unable to connect to Database 
Msg: Failed to connect to server: localhost Server returned: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES) </pre></li><li>[https://sourceforge.net/projects/freeghost/forums/forum/716419/topic/4859086/index/page/1 Scheduled Tasks fail to run]</li></ul>
How to update it:<br>
:Changing the root admin password in MySQL is not simple. It's a lot easier to enter a known root password in the file mentioned below. This is an older guide, but might be helpful if a root password is lost:
http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/442
<ul>Additional notes<li>In a private network this is usually not set. The installer urges a blank password.</li>
<li>The password is also in the following files:<ul><li><tt>/var/www/fog/commons/config.php</tt></li>
<li><tt>/opt/fog/service/etc/config.php</tt></li></ul></li>
</ul>

====FOG Quick Image password====
How to update it:<br>
From the GUI: 
:About > PXE Boot Menu > 
From command line (note this will be overwritten if the GUI is updated)
:<tt>sudo vi tftpboot\pxelinux.cfg\default</tt>


== Additional Passwords Outside of a Basic Installation ==

=== Storage Nodes ===
====FOG user account on storage node====
	<ul>Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
		<li><unknown></li>
	</ul>
How to update it:
:On the Storage Node: <tt>sudo passwd fog</tt>
====MySQL connector back to Main FOG server====
	<ul>Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
		<li><tt>/images/</tt> directory does not update - contains no images</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
How to update it:
<pre>vi /var/www/fog/commons/config.php
define( "MYSQL_DATABASE", "fog" ); 
define( "MYSQL_USERNAME", "fogstorage" ); 
define( "MYSQL_PASSWORD", "b83cd3" );</pre>
====FTP Connection from Storage Node to Master FOG Server====
	<ul>Common errors associated with this mismatched password:
		<li><unknown at this time></li>
	</ul>
How to test it:
<OL><LI>On the Master FOG Server, copy the password from this file: 
<pre>cat /var/www/fog/commons/config.php
...
...
...
define( "STORAGE_FTP_USERNAME", "fog" );
define( "STORAGE_FTP_PASSWORD", "[---------longPassword---------]" );
...</pre></LI>
<li>Using the above credentials, attempt an FTP session back to the Main FOG Server<br>
From the Storage Node:<pre>ftp [FOG_Main_Server_IPAddr]
Connected to [IPAddr].
220 (vsFTPd 2.2.2)
Name ([IPAddr]:[user]):fog
331 Please specify the password.
Password: [paste that longPassword from above]
230 Login successful.</pre>
</LI></ol>
To verify that FTP is functional:
<OL><li><unknown at this time></LI>
</OL>
