This article is a general guide on migrating wiki pages to md pages on the new site

## General Process

* Move the .txt file to In-Progress
* Move the md file to a new home in the docs folder that makes sense in the structure
* Some of them probably don't need to be migrated and can just be moved straight to done
* We can call the pages done once
	-   it's moved to a new home
	-   It's reformatted to mkdocs/obsidian markdown including 'front-matter' with tags
	-   Content is updated to match current versions
	-   A link to the new doc is put in the wiki

### Tips

* You can browse to the old wiki page and save the webpage/site as html from your browser to quickly download all pictures
	* You should put the pictures somewhere in docs/assets/img with a unique name for roaming links to work no matter where they are in that assets/img folder
