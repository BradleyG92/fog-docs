'''Note about using Windows 7 OEM license'''

Microsoft has changed their reimaging license in February 2011 so that you can't distribute an OEM image if you doesn't buy a full packaged product (FPP) or have a Volume Licensing program. This means that you have to buy an extra Win7 license besides the Win7 OEM license included in most computers.

Text from the Microsoft license document:
''"Organizations do not have the right to reimage by using OEM media. An OEM image can only be preloaded on a PC by the OEM during manufacturing."''
