Hopefully this bug will be fixed before anyone else experiences it, but just in case I'm creating this page so it may come up in searches.<br><br>
When installing FOG server the option to notify the developers is presented:
<pre>  Would you like to notify the FOG group about this installation?
    * This information is only used to help the FOG group determine
      if FOG is being used.  This information helps to let us know
      if we should keep improving this product.

  Send notification? (Y/N)y
  * Thank you, sending notification.....</pre>
Since the developers coded this feature in, we might assume they appreciate knowing how many people are using FOG. In one person's experience, this step freezes more often than not. If you choose Yes and it takes longer than a few seconds, it is likely frozen. If the script never finishes, the completion message is never printed. Final configurations may or may not have been completed.

=== Solution ===
<ol><li>Log into another terminal to the same server:<br>
:Either open a second SSH connection, or press [http://linux.about.com/od/linux101/l/blnewbie5_1.htm CTRL-ALT-F1] to open a new terminal on the local machine. <br>
::NOTE: Pressing CTRL-ALT-'''F7''' will take you back to the graphical screen. You might want to write that down.</li>
<li>Use <tt>ps</tt> to list all processes that are currently using the <tt>wget</tt> command (this is how the notification is sent)<pre>$ ps -ef | grep wget
root     21794 11185  0 20:16 pts/0    00:00:00 wget -q -O - http://freeghost.no-ip.org/notify/index.php?version=0.29
myuser   22005 21962  0 21:01 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto wget
</pre></li>
<li>Kill the hung thread: (substitute the process ID from your <tt>ps</tt> result)<pre>$ sudo kill 21794</pre></li>
<li>Return to the original terminal to see the installation process complete:

  Setup complete!

  You still need to install/update your database schema.
