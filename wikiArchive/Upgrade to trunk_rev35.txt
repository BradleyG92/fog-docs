=Methods=
*There are a few methods to update to the most resent revision. Each method has its pros so, you will need to figure out which you will use.
**'''SVN'''
**'''Git'''
**'''BTSync'''
**'''wget'''
*Remember these are mostly betas so there are bound to be bugs, but with bugs also comes fixes of the issues found in the "Stable Release"
*If you have nodes they will also need to be upgraded! (Excluding Beta [[Windows_Storage_Node | Windows Nodes]])


==SVN==
*Install as seen in '''[[SVN]]'''
<pre>svn co https://svn.code.sf.net/p/freeghost/code/trunk /some/local/folder</pre>

*Then navigate to the folder you specified and run:

<pre>sudo /some/local/folder/bin/./installfog.sh</pre>

===Update to latest===
<pre>cd  /some/local/folder/
svn up
cd bin
./installfog.sh</pre>

*''NOTE:'' You must run '''svn up''' in the "/some/local/folder/" and not in ".../fog/bin" nor in ".../fog"

===Check your SVN version===
<pre>
cd  /some/local/folder/
svn log -v
</pre>

=== Upgrade to specific revision ===

This is recommended only for experienced FOG users: [[Upgrade to Revision]]


----

==Git==

*Install Git

<pre>
sudo apt-get install git
</pre>

*Initial Setup
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject.git /some/local/folder
</pre>

=== Update to latest ===
<pre>
cd /some/local/folder
git pull
cd bin
./installfog.sh
</pre>

=== Check your git version ===
<pre>
cd /some/local/folder
git log -1
</pre>

----

==BTSync==
*If you want the latest, get on the BTsync :) You could have changes within 20-30 seconds of them being made.
**'''NOTE:''' as of 2901 the kernels are no longer synced using BTSync. They auto download when installing the fog script.
<pre>
Fog Read only Secret: BAU3NUY3XTKVMHHEZO6C7OH55AN2PCGJV
</pre>

*Create the location that you want to have synced.

<pre>
sudo mkdir /fog
sudo chrmod 777 /fog
</pre>

*Install BTsync:

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tuxpoldo/btsync
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install btsync
cd Downloads
tar xzpf btsync_i386.tar.gz (I have downloaded 32 bit. So check your version)
./btsync
</pre>

*Open a webpage: <IP Address>:8888

<pre>
Add Folder:
Secret: BAU3NUY3XTKVMHHEZO6C7OH55AN2PCGJV
Path: /fog
</pre>

*Then <u>'''Any time'''</u> you see an update. Open up your terminal:

<pre>
cd /fog/bin/
sudo ./installfog.sh
</pre>
And you are updated quite quickly!

----

==wget==
<pre>
wget --no-check-certificate http://mastacontrola.com/fog_trunk.tar.bz2
</pre>
*Once downloaded you'll need to unpack the bz2 file using the command:
<pre>
tar -xjf fog_trunk.tar.bz2
</pre>
*Then go into the unextracted file.  Follow these steps:
<pre>
  cd fog_trunk/bin
  ./installfog.sh
</pre>

= Congratulations =
* Congrats! You have now upgraded to the "bleeding edge" of FOG deployment. It is your responsibility to keep upgraded until the next "Stable Release". Until then you will see in the ''cloud'' of your ''Web Gui'' '''rXXXX'''. This indicates the revision you are now on.
*You can check for updates to the revisions under [[File:1.3.0 fog configuration.png]] '''Fog Configuration'''. This will state the version you are on and what the lastest revision is.

= Additional information on svn and git & FOG Trunk =


Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after the command name svn) is a software package that allows you to 'check out' software. SVN in and of itself is not FOG, but a lot of FOG users use it. It's provided by [http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge]. Git allows the same general functions as svn and is provided by [https://github.com/ GitHub]. Either method is as valid as the other, albeit the commands are different for each. 


FOG developmental versions are called "revisions." Revisions are normally stable for the PRIMARY functions of FOG: '''IMAGE > NAME > JOIN TO DOMAIN using UNICAST and MULTICAST'''

Other features in FOG revisions (not directly related to the imaging process) '''are sometimes broken'''. The developers are pretty good about fixing issues when someone finds and reports it. These other features usually do not impact imaging. Additionally, if you encounter an issue, let us know about it in the [https://forums.fogproject.org/ forums] and someone is likely to help and/or fix it quickly, making a new "revision" that you can download and install very quickly using the above methods.


However, with the current revisions, you'll benefit from a '''plethora of bug fixes''', a much '''wider range of supported host hardware''', and '''new features'''!


Updating FOG from one revision to a newer one usually takes less than a minute or two. Fog uses your settings from previous installations so you don't have to answer questions about the installation or set additional configurations. '''FOG supports upgrading, but not downgrading'''. If you would like to roll-back to a previous version, generally, this can only be done by reverting to a previous snap-shot taken from a virtualized machine that FOG is installed on.

It's advised to backup your database and export your hosts (and label the files) prior to upgrading. You can do that like this on 1.2.0 and higher:
'''FOG Configuration -> Configuration Save -> Export
Host Management -> Export Hosts -> Export'''


You may install FOG Trunk on a server that does not have FOG installed already.


On your FOG's web GUI login page, you can quickly check what revision you're running:
