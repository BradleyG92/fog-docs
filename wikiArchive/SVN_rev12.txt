=== GUI Subversion clients ===

Coming from a Windows background, some people may prefer using a GUI Subversion client, rather than the standard, basic command-line client. If you feel comfortable with a file system browser/explorer integrated Subversion client, then [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] is the best choice - it is extremely popular. <br />

Another tool that is simple to configure and easy to understand, but is a traditional one-window application like Microsoft &trade; Visual Source Safe &trade; is [http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/ RapidSVN]. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RapidSVN It is cross-platform] and has a simple interface, in one place unlike TortoiseSVN.
