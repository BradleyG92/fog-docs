In most versions of FOG (including 1.2.0 and 1.3.0), the low-level settings that are used during installation and some settings that simply cannot be stored in the database are contained in the /opt/fog/.fogsettings file.

Here are what the settings in this file mean:

Hey, I was wanting to more thoroughly document the settings in /opt/fog/.fogsettings

This is my starting place. I know what most of these things do already but not all. This can also be a place where others can learn what these settings do as well.

If anyone knows more, or can add more, please do share.
