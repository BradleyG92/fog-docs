*Multicasting in FOG uses UDPcast to send a single image to multiple computers using only slightly more bandwidth than sending the image to a single computer or unicast.  Multicasting in FOG may require special switch configuration. A multicast will not begin until all members are ready to begin by default. This can be changed by editing UDPSENDER_MAXWAIT in /opt/fog/service/etc/config.php which is in seconds. 

== Queuing ==

*FOG uses a simple queuing system to prevent its storage servers from being overworked.  If you have a single FOG storage node in FOG with a queue size of 10, then this means that if you unicast an image to 30 computers, only the first 10 computers will be imaged.  The other 20 computers will be waiting "in queue" for an open slot.  What will be seen on the client side is the following:

*[[File:Queue.jpg]]

*This queue system allows for the IT staff to start tasks for hundreds or thousands of computers and let FOG manage the clients so the servers don't get overwhelmed with client requests.

== Test Multicasting ==
*Environment:
**FOG server
**Two or more identical computers
**Ethernet hub or FastEthernet switch in same VLAN.

*View Multicast status on server use tty2 or /opt/fog/log/multicast.log

*Overall image time will be slower than unicast on same hardware and same image because unicast is gunzip(unzip) at client level, multicast in gunzip at server level. 

*If errors persist in test environment post log in forum.

== Device Configurations ==
*[[Cisco_Multi_Cast|Cisco Multicast - Layer 3]]
*[[HPMulticast|HP Multicast - Layer 2&3]]
*Check your network settings, as of Fog v1.0.0, Fog is now using [[iPXE]] which is a different animal.

== Fog Settings ==
* Fog has a few features built directly for multicasting. (r2903)
*[[File:config.png]] '''Fog Configuration''' --> '''Fog Settings''' --> '''Multicast Settings'''
**FOG_UDPCAST_INTERFACE -- Network connection for multicast broadcasting ['''Default: eth0''']
**FOG_UDPCAST_STARTINGPORT -- PORT for multicast broadcasting ['''Default: 63100''']
**FOG_MULTICAST_MAX_SESSIONS -- Max number of sessions ['''Default: 64''']
**FOG_UDPCAST_MAXWAIT -- Max wait time(minutes) to wait for clients until starting (If client does not start it will be "left behind") ['''Default: 10''']
**FOG_MULTICAST_ADDRESS -- Sets an alternate IP address if required (Proper format: XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) ['''Default: 0''']
**FOG_MULTICAST_PORT_OVERRIDE -- Sets a Port override if required ['''Default:0''']

== Troubleshooting == 
===General Troubleshooting===
==== Upgrade FOG ====
* As a general rule, Fog is constantly in development and constantly growing. The lease you can do to help fix your Multi-Cast issues is to upgrade FOG to the latest release.
* At times the developers will ask a user to upgrade to the '''"trunk"''' release and run a test. If you are one of these people you must keep in line with the upgrades and keep upgrading until the next release is issued.
**'''"trunk"''' updates come at least once a day and quite possible a dozen a day.
** To upgrade to trunk please see [[Upgrade_to_trunk]]
====Stop Multicasting====
* Stop all multitasks currently running
#On your server open up terminal and kill any running udpcasts by typing
#*<pre>sudo killall udp-sender</pre>
==== Testing 1 Client====
#Now start a multicasting session using theses arguments. This will dump the logs into this file and allow a 1 minute start time for the session
#*<pre>sudo udp-sender --file /opt/fog/.fogsettings --log /opt/fog/log/multicast.log  --ttl 1 --nopointopoint</pre>
#Looking at the output you should see:
#*Udp-sender xxxxxxxx
#*Using [full duplex mode]
#Your server is now waiting for your clients to boot
#*If you receive a '''"Extra argument "/opt/fog/log/multicast.log" ignored"''' you missed a dash or something is miss spelled.
#* Do a ctrl+c to stop and double check your command for syntax errors
#* See [[https://www.udpcast.linux.lu/cmd.html UDPCast]] for other arguments available
#Now boot up 1 client go to your ''FOG Menu'' and select debug mode.
#*If debug is '''not''' located on your ''FOG Menu'' then you will need to add it. See [[FOG Menu]] (v1.3.0)
#*You can also accomplish this by creating a Debug task in the Fog Web GUI and then network boot the client
#*Do this on the same subnet if possible. 
#Type in to the client running multicast debug:
#*<pre>udp-receiver</pre>
#On your server you should see that 1 client connected
#* Then you can press any key on the client (Start client first)
#On your client you should see the contents of your .fogsettings file scrolling by the screen.
#* You may also see the output log in  your FOG GUI under '''Log Viewer'''
#Results:
#*'''Success:''' Continue to section [[Multicasting#Testing_2_Clients| Testing 2 Clients]]
#*'''Failed''' If it doesn't work then you need to check your switch/router settings against. See [[IPXE]] and the settings suggested there.

====Testing 2 Clients====
*Hopefully you succeeded in testing [[Multicasting#Testing_1_Client| 1 client]] above.  Now we need to test '''2 clients'''. 
# Start another multicast session again but this time run
#*<pre>sudo udp-sender --file /opt/fog/.fogsettings --log /opt/fog/log/multicast.log  --ttl 32 --nopointopoint</pre>
#Boot both clients in debug mode and run
#*<pre>udb-receiver</pre>
#On your server you should see now that both clients are connected
#* Then you can press any key on the client(s) (Start client(s) first)
#* Then press any key on the server to start the transfer (Start server last)
#Results:
#*'''Success:''' If both clients receive the .fogsettings file it seems that all of your multicast settings are correct and the problem may lie within FOG configuration/settings
#*'''Failed''' If it doesn't work then you need to check your switch/router settings. See [[IPXE]] and the settings suggested there.

====Something else to try====
#If it does work then good lets try one more step
#* On your server run this:
#*<pre>gunzip -c "/images/anyimagename" | /usr/local/sbin/udp-sender --min-receivers 2 --portbase 9000 --interface yourInterface --half-duplex --ttl 32</pre>
#Now boot up 2 clients in debug mode and type into the clients
#*<pre>udp-receiver --portbase 9000 --mcast-rdv-address fogserverIP | partimage -f3 -b restore /dev/sda stdin</pre>
#*you might need to change /dev/sda to your correct harddrive if it's different use fdisk -l to find out
#Results:
#*'''Success:''' If the clients start imaging then your network and multicast settings an are correct.
**The problem may lie within FOG configuration/settings
#*'''Failed''' If it doesn't work then you need to check your switch/router settings

===Please Wait===
*Hang at the "Please Wait" screen:

*Verify the host name (without dns suffix) is listed in the /etc/hosts file to the actual IP address (not 127.0.0.1)
example: "192.168.0.77 myfogserver"

*Check the MySQL details in "/opt/fog/service/etc/config.php" are correct.
*If not, correct them (they should be the same as in /var/www/fog/commons/config.php) and restart the service 
<pre>$sudo /etc/init.d/FOGMulticastManager restart</pre>

===Kill Multitasking===
*If you wish to force kill all the multicasting sessions please do '''BOTH''' the following


*Remove any sessions running in the sql database
<pre>
mysql -u root <-p password> fog
truncate table multicastSessions;
truncate table multicastSessionsAssoc;
exit;
</pre>
*Stop any udp senders that may be running on the server
<pre>
sudo service FOGMulticastManager stop
sudo killall udp-sender
sudo killall udp-sender
sudo killall udp-sender
sudo service FOGMulticastManager start
</pre>

==STP/Portfast/RSTP/MSTP==
* Sometimes unicast will work and multicast fails. You may need to check your managed switch settings.
