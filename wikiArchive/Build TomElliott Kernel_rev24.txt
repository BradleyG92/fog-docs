'''PRE BUILD ENVIRONMENT IS ASSUMED ALREADY INSTALLED ON THE SYSTEM YOU'RE BUILDING'''
NOTE: It is assumed you have root access to the system you're building this on.  It also assumes you know your CWD (Current Working Directory).
= Build TomElliott Kernel =
The below instructions are to build the TomElliott kernel.  There is an extra step involved compared to the normal kernel build as there are firmware's built directly into the kernels now.
== Download the Kernel ==
As of the time of this writing kernel 3.13 is the latest.  You can use previous, or future kernels as well though.
<pre>wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.x/linux-3.13.tar.xz</pre>

== Uncompress the kernel ==
<pre>tar -xf linux-3.13.tar.xz</pre>

== Go into uncompressed linux kernel directory ==
<pre>cd linux-3.13</pre>

== Download the prerequisite package '''(THE EXTRA STEP IS HERE)''' ==
<pre>git clone https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git</pre>

== Prepare the build ==
<pre>make ARCH=i386 menuconfig</pre>
Add any choices, or don't but when you exit, it will ask you to save the config, '''NEEDED'''.

After you've saved the config.

== Build the bzImage ==
<pre>make ARCH=i386 bzImage</pre>

This will take a while.  Once successful, it will say bzImage created.

== Copy the built firmware to your FOG Server's kernel directory. ==
NOTE: In my example, the FOG Server is the same as my build system.
NOTE: Recommend to make a backup of the original /tftpboot/fog/kernel/bzImage before continuing just in case.
<pre>cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /tftpboot/fog/kernel/bzImage</pre>
