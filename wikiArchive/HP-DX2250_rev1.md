In order to create an image from, or restore an image to an HP DX2250
computer you\'ll need to change the SATA settings in the system CMOS.

1.  Enter the system CMOS by pressed F9 as the system boots
2.  Under \'Advanced\' change the SATA emulation mode from Legacy IDE to
    Standard IDE
3.  FOG will now detect your hard drive and partitions properly
