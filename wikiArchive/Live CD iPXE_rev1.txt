Maybe we can have live cd's without the need to extract and find special parameters.

This example is specific to the Parted live cd, but maybe it'll apply to other live cd's as well.

<pre>:parted
initrd ${boot-url}/iso/pmagic.iso
chain memdisk ||
echo failed to boot
prompt
goto MENU</pre>

Notice that the chain memdisk command is missing the iso and iso raw statements.

Please give this a shot and let us know.

Thank you,
