All 15 Dell Dimension 2400 we have add an extra character to the initial PXE filename when doing the initial request to the TFTP server

A simple (if inelegant) solution is to add a symbolic link to the correct file in the /tftpboot directory:

ln -s /tftpboot/pxelinux.0 /tftpboot/pxelinux.0ÿ

(the final character is a lower case y umlaut) To diagnose the issue, add several -v parameters the /etc/default/tftpd-hpa file (before the -s parameter), and look in /var/log/syslog for tftp client failures

Possibly a better solution would be to use a filename map.
